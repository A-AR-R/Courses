\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose we have a relation on attributes A, B, C, D, E, and F , and these functional dependencies hold: $S=\{B\to DE, BF \to C, CF \to B, DF \to AE\}$.
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item 
            \[
                B^+ = BDE
            \]
            \item 
            \[
                CF^+ = ABCDEF
            \]
            \item 
            \[
                DF^+ = ADEF
            \]
            \item 
            \[
                BC^+ = BCDE
            \]
            \item 
            \[
                ABC^+ = ABCDE
            \]
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
    \item Again,suppose we have a relation on attributes A, B, C, D, E, and F,and these functional dependencies hold : $S = \{ B\to DE, BF \to C, CF\to B, DF\to AE \}.$
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Does it follow from $S$ that $B\to A$ ? \\
            No, because $A$ not in $B^+$ from Q1
            \item Does it follow from $S$ that $CF\to E$ ? \\ 
            Yes, because $E$ in $CF^+$ from Q1
            \item Does it follow from $S$ that $DF\to B$ ? \\
            No, because $B$ not in $DF^+$ from Q1
            \item Does it follow from $S$ that $BD\to C$ ? \\
            \[
                BD^+ = BDE
            \]
            So No, $C$ not in $BD^+$
            \item Does it follow from $S$ that $BFC\to A$ ? \\
            \[
                BFC^+ = ABCDEF
            \]
            Yes, since $A$ in $BFC^+$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
    \item Suppose we have a relation with attributes ABCDE and these functional dependencies $S = \{ A \to D, B\to A, C\to A, D\to CE \}$ Project functional dependencies onto $ABD$
    \begin{solution}
        \[
            A^+ = ACDE \text{  so  } A \to D
        \]
        \[
            B^+ = ABCDE \text{  so  } B \to AD
        \]
        \[
            D^+ = ACDE \text{  so  } D \to A
        \]
        Dont have to consider superset of $B$, since it functionally determines all of $ABD$. 
        \[
            AD^+ = ACDE 
        \]
        which does not yield new FDs so the projection of $S$ onto $ABD$ is 
        \[
            \{  A \to D, B \to AD, D\to A \}
        \]
    \end{solution}
    \item Consider relation $R(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ with functional dependencies 
    \[
        S = \{ CD \to A, B \to EF, A\to BC, F\to D \}
    \]
    Create an instance of $R$ that satisfies its FDs and has redundant data. Identify redundancy by circling a single value in the table that could be erased and yet we would know what its value must be. (what does it have to do with FDs)? 
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ || c | c | c | c | c | c|| }    A & B & C & D & E & F \\ 
            \hline
            3 & 1 & 4 & {\color{red} 1} & 5 & 6 \\ 
            3 & 1 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 6 \\ 
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        Note the cell is colored instead of circled due to technical difficulty with latex. We can deduce the minimal basis for the set of FDs. 
    \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
