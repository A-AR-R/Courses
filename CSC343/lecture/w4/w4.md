#### Intro to SQL [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/basics.html)




```
Student(sID, surName, firstName, campus, email, cgpa)
Course(dept, cnum, name, breadth)
Offering(oID, dept, cNum, term, instructor)
Took(sID, oID, grade)
```

```sql 
select name from Course where dept='CSC';
```
+ _select-from-where quries_
    + `SELECT`
        + project operator
    + `WHERE`
        + select operator

```sql
select name, sid, grade from Course, Offering, Took where Course.dept='CSC';
```
+ _cartesian product_ 
    + simply a list of comma-separated list in `FROM` clause

+ _compound conditions in `where`_
    + with logical, boolean (`AND` `OR` `NOT`) operators

```sql
select * from Course where dept='CSC';
```
+ _wildcard `select`_


```sql
select name as title, dept, from Course where breadth;
```
+ _renaming columns_ 
    + with `<orig> AS <new>` 

```sql
select sid, grade from Took where grade > 90 order by grade;
select sid, grade from Took where grade > 90 order by grade desc;
```
+ _sorting_ 
    + with `ORDER BY`
        + defaults to `ASCE` (vs. `DESC`)

```sql
select sid, grade + 10 as adjusted from Took;
select dept || cnum from Course where cnum < 200;
```
+ _expression in `select` clause_
    + _arithmetic_ 
        + `grade + 10`
    + _string concat_ 
        + `dept || cnum`

```sql
select name, 'satisfies' as breadthRequirement from Course where braedth;
```
+ _expression as a constant in `select`_


+ _case-sensitivity and whitespace_
    + keywords and identifiers (for table, colname) not case-sensitive
    + line breaks and tabs ignored

#### Aggregation and Grouping [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/aggregation.html)


+ _computing on a column_ 
    + _motivation_  
        + compute across all values in a column (i.e. sum)
    + _aggregation_     
        + expression used in `SELECT` which apply to a column
        + `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`

```sql
select avg(grade) from Took;
select max(grade) - min(grade) from Took;
select max(grade) - min(grade) as range from Took;
select count(grade) from Took; -- number of values in the column
select count(*) from Took;     -- wildcard, get number of rows   
```



```sql
select count(dept) from Offering;           -- includes duplicates
select count(distinct dept) from Offering;  -- each value of dept contribute once
```
+ _when duplicates contribute_
    + each row contribute to aggregation despite duplicates
        + i.e. if 87 occur 12 times in a table, all 12 contribute to `avg(grade)`
    + sometimes want to disregard duplicates
        + with `distinct <colname>`
            + affects aggregate functions other than `min` `max`
        + i.e. find out different types of departments 

+ _include multiple aggregations_ 

```sql
select sid, grade from Took group by sid; -- error! sid and grade dimension mismatch
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid;
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid order by avg(grade);
```
+ _grouping_ 
    + `GROUP BY <attr>`    
        + tuples with same value for an attribute will be treated as a group
        + one row will be generated for each group

```sql
-- error! since grouped by sid, so every group 
-- has one sid, but not necessarily one oid
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid, order by oid; 
-- OK
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid, order by count(oid);
```
+ _grouping then orderby_ 
    + ordered attribute does not have to be an expressin in `SELECT`


```sql
-- error, 
-- since ask for one row per dept-cnum combination, i.e. csc330
-- but projecting on oid, term, instructor is wrong
-- have to do aggregates
select * from Offering group by dept, cnum; 
-- OK
select dept, cnum, count(cum), from Offering group by dept, cnum;
```
+ _group by multiple columns_
    + allowed
    + idea is to have one row for each group defined as a unique combination of `attr ..`



#### Having [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/having.html)


+ _restriction on `having`_ 
    + A HAVING clause may refer to an attribute only if it is either aggregated or is an attribute on the GROUP BY list. This is the same requirement as for SELECT clauses with aggregation, and it makes sense for the same reason. It's all to do with quantities.

+ _order of execution_ 
    + FROM clause: 
        + This determines what table(s) will be examined.
        + If there is more than one, the tables are joined together as specified. In any case, the rows are iterated over.
    + WHERE clause: 
        + This filters rows.
        + Notice that the SELECT has not happened yet, so we can't reference any column names that it defines.
    + GROUP BY clause: 
        + This organizes the rows into groups, each of which will be represented by one row in the result table.
        + If there is also a HAVING clause, only groups that pass its filter are included.
    + HAVING clause: 
        + This filters groups.
        + Since this happens before the SELECT clause, it can refer to attributes that are not included in the SELECT.
    + SELECT clause: 
        + This chooses which columns to include in the result.
        + It may introduce new column names.
    + ORDER BY clause: 
        + This sorts the rows of the result table.
        + Since it occurs after the SELECT clause, it can reference column names that are introduced there.


#### view [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/views.html)

+ view
    + a definition, recomputed everytime used 
    + `CREATE VIEW foo AS <query>`



#### Set and bags [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/sets-bags.html)

+ _bag semantics_
    + SQL table, 
        + allowing duplicate rows (as long as there is no key constraints)
    + _select-from-where_
        + leaves duplicates by default
        ```sql 
        SELECT oid FROM Took WHERE grade > 95;
        ```
        + enforce set semantics with `distinct`
        ```sql 
        SELECT distinct oid FROM Took WHERE grade > 95;
        ```
        + `distinct`
            + works at level of row, not of a single cell, 
            + simply turns result of query into sets
            + so one `distinct` before column names in `select`
                ```sql
                SELECT DISTINCT oid, DISTINCT grade -- ERROR  
                SELECT DISTINCT oid, grade          -- OK
                ```
            + or inside aggregations, 
                ```sql 
                SELECT count(DISTINCT sid), count(distinct oid) FROM Took;
                ```
+ _union, intersect, set differences_ 
    + requires compatible schemas
    ```sql
    (SELECT sid, grade FROM Took WHERE grade > 95)
    UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
    (SELECT sid, grade FROM Took WHERE grade < 50);
    ```
    + _set semantics by default_ 
        + duplicates eliminated 
    + _bag semantics with `ALL`_
        + `union`: dump everything together
        + `intersect`: match up individual elements
            + `{1, 1, 1, 3, 7, 7, 8} ∩ {1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8} = {1, 7, 7, 8}`
        + `difference`: 
            + match up individual elements, 
            + look at each element in second bag
            + if possible, remove matching element from first bag 
            + result is what is left in first bag 
            + `{1, 1, 1, 3, 7, 7, 8} − {1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8} = {1, 1, 3}`
            + vs set semantics, where a single value in second set wipe out all instances in first set
    ```sql 
    (SELECT sid FROM Took WHERE grade > 95) 
    UNION ALL 
    (SELECT sid FROM Took WHERE grade < 90) 
    ```
