#### Intro to SQL [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/basics.html)




```
Student(sID, surName, firstName, campus, email, cgpa)
Course(dept, cnum, name, breadth)
Offering(oID, dept, cNum, term, instructor)
Took(sID, oID, grade)
```

```sql 
select name from Course where dept='CSC';
```
+ _select-from-where quries_
    + `SELECT`
        + project operator
    + `WHERE`
        + select operator

```sql
select name, sid, grade from Course, Offering, Took where Course.dept='CSC';
```
+ _cartesian product_ 
    + simply a list of comma-separated list in `FROM` clause

+ _compound conditions in `where`_
    + with logical, boolean (`AND` `OR` `NOT`) operators

```sql
select * from Course where dept='CSC';
```
+ _wildcard `select`_


```sql
select name as title, dept, from Course where breadth;
```
+ _renaming columns_ 
    + with `<orig> AS <new>` 

```sql
select sid, grade from Took where grade > 90 order by grade;
select sid, grade from Took where grade > 90 order by grade desc;
```
+ _sorting_ 
    + with `ORDER BY`
        + defaults to `ASCE` (vs. `DESC`)

```sql
select sid, grade + 10 as adjusted from Took;
select dept || cnum from Course where cnum < 200;
```
+ _expression in `select` clause_
    + _arithmetic_ 
        + `grade + 10`
    + _string concat_ 
        + `dept || cnum`

```sql
select name, 'satisfies' as breadthRequirement from Course where braedth;
```
+ _expression as a constant in `select`_


+ _case-sensitivity and whitespace_
    + keywords and identifiers (for table, colname) not case-sensitive
    + line breaks and tabs ignored

#### Aggregation and Grouping [reading](http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/fall/readings/SQL/aggregation.html)


+ _computing on a column_ 
    + _motivation_  
        + compute across all values in a column (i.e. sum)
    + _aggregation_     
        + expression used in `SELECT` which apply to a column
        + `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`

```sql
select avg(grade) from Took;
select max(grade) - min(grade) from Took;
select max(grade) - min(grade) as range from Took;
select count(grade) from Took; -- number of values in the column
select count(*) from Took;     -- wildcard, get number of rows   
```



```sql
select count(dept) from Offering;           -- includes duplicates
select count(distinct dept) from Offering;  -- each value of dept contribute once
```
+ _when duplicates contribute_
    + each row contribute to aggregation despite duplicates
        + i.e. if 87 occur 12 times in a table, all 12 contribute to `avg(grade)`
    + sometimes want to disregard duplicates
        + with `distinct <colname>`
            + affects aggregate functions other than `min` `max`
        + i.e. find out different types of departments 

+ _include multiple aggregations_ 

```sql
select sid, grade from Took group by sid; -- error! sid and grade dimension mismatch
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid;
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid order by avg(grade);
```
+ _grouping_ 
    + `GROUP BY <attr>`    
        + tuples with same value for an attribute will be treated as a group
        + one row will be generated for each group

```sql
-- error! since grouped by sid, so every group 
-- has one sid, but not necessarily one oid
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid, order by oid; 
-- OK
select sid, avg(grade) from Took group by sid, order by count(oid);
```
+ _grouping then orderby_ 
    + ordered attribute does not have to be an expressin in `SELECT`


```sql
-- error, 
-- since ask for one row per dept-cnum combination, i.e. csc330
-- but projecting on oid, term, instructor is wrong
-- have to do aggregates
select * from Offering group by dept, cnum; 
-- OK
select dept, cnum, count(cum), from Offering group by dept, cnum;
```
+ _group by multiple columns_
    + allowed
    + idea is to have one row for each group defined as a unique combination of `attr ..`
