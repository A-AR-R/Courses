+ _Decomposition goal_ 
    + no anomalies (duplicates)
    + lossless join
        + project original relations onto decomposed schema
        + reconstruct original by joining, should be exactly the original tuples
            + if get spurious tuples, then lossy
    + dependency preservation

+ _3NF_
    + _prime_ 
            + `X` is prime if it is a member of any key
    + `X -> A` violates 3NF iff
        + `X` not a superkey 
        + `A` not prime


![](2017-12-05-14-06-51.png)
+ _3NF synthesis_  
    + find minimal basis
    + for each `X -> Y` 
        + define new relation with schema `X cup Y`
    + if no relation is a superkey for `L`
        + add a relation whose schema is some key
    + how does this ensure that `A` is at least prime?


+ _decomposition_ 
    + no anomalies
        + BCNF
    + lossless join 
        + BCNF decomposition
            + however, BCNF property does not guarantee this
        + 3NF
    + dependency preservation
        + 3NF


+ _chase test_ 
    + tests for if a schema guarantees lossless join
    + idea
        + assume `t=abc...` in final projection
        + for 2 rows agree on LHS of a FD, make RHS agree too 
        + replace a subscripted symbol by corresponding unsubscripted on, if possible
        + if get a completely unsubscripted row, konw any tuple in the project-join is in the original (join is lossless)
        + otherwise, final tableau is a counter example (join is lossy)
