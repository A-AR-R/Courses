+ _history_ 
    + file system as DBMS

### 1.2 Overview of a database management system


+ _data-definition language_ 
    + used to define/alter _schema_ 
        + structure
        + constraint
+ _data-manipulation language_ 
    + does not affect schema, but may affect content of database
    + can extract data from database
+ _query processing_    
    + ![](2017-09-16-12-25-00.png)
    + _steps_
        + _query compiler_ 
            + translates query into an internal form called _query plan_
            + a sequence of operations on data
            + _components_ 
                + _parser_ builds syntax tre
                + _preprocessor_ semantic checks 
                + _optimizer_ transforms initial query plan into best available squence of operation on data 
                    + with help of metadata (schema, index)
        + _execution engine_ 
            + executing each step in the query plan
        + _concurrency-control manager_ (scheduler)
            + assure atomicity and isolation of trasaction
        + _logging and recovery manager_
            + responsible for durability of transaction
            + logs states and restore states during failure
        + _buffer manager_
            + partition main memory into buffers
            + communicates with a storage manager to get data
        + _storage manager_     
            + control placement of data on disk and movement between disk and memory
+ _transaction processing_ 
    + _transaction_ 
        + units that must be executed atomically, and in isolation
        + execution must be _durable_, i.e. incomplete trasatoin must be preserved even if system fails 
    + _ACID_    
        + atomicity
        + consistency
            + consistency constraint
        + isolation
            + each transaction appear to execute as if no other transaction is executing
        + durability




#### 2.3 Defining a Relation Schema in SQL 


+ SQL
    + language in describing and manipulating relational database
    + _data-definition_ 
        + declaring schemas 
    + _data-manipulation_ 
        + querying and modifying
+ _Relations in SQL_ 
    + _stored relations (tables)_ 
        + a relation that exists in the database, and 
        + can be modified, queried
    + _views_   
        + relations defined by a computation 
        + not stored but constructed
    + _temporary tables_ 
        + constructed by SQL language processor when performing jobs of executing queries and data modifications 
        + not stored and cannot be declared
+ _data types_ 
    + `CHAR(n)` 
        + fix-length string up to `n` characters, 
        + usually makes short strings to be padded
    + `VARCHAR(n)` 
        + string up to `n` characters, 
        + usually an endmarker (`\n`) or string-length is used
    + `BIT(n)` `BIT VARYING(n)` 
        + bit strings of fixed and varying length 
    + `BOOLEAN` 
        + logical `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `UNKNOWN`
    + `INT` or `INTEGER` 
    + `SHORTINT`
        + number of bits may be less
    + `FLOAT` or `REAL`
        + floating-point numbers
    + `DOUBLE PRECISION`
    + `DECIMAL(n,d)`
        + real numbers with a fixed decimal point
        + `NUMERIC` is synonymous
    + `DATE`
        + char strings of a specific format 
        + `DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'`
    + `TIME`
        + `TIME '15::00::02.5'`
+ _declaring tables_ 
    ```sql 
    CREATE TABLE Movies (
        title CHAR(100),
        year INT,
        length INT, 
        genre CHAR(10),
        studioName CHAR(30),
        producerC# INT
    );
    ```
+ _modifying relation schemas_  
    + _drop schema_
        ```sql 
        DROP TABLE R;
        ```
    + _modify_ `ALTER TABLE` ... 
        + `ADD attr datatype`
            + add an attribute
            ```sql 
            ALTER TABLE MovieStar ADD phone CHAR(16);
            ```
            + default to `NULL` 
        + `DROP attr`
            + drop an attributes
            ```sql 
            ALTER TABLE MovieStar DROP birthdate;
            ```
+ _default values_ 
    + `DEFAULT`
        + either `NULL `or a constant 
    ```sql 
    CREATE TABLE Movies (
        gender CHAR(1) DEFAULT '?'
        birthdate DATE DEFAULT DATE '0000-00-00'
    );
    ```
    ```sql 
    ALTER TABLE MovieStar ADD phone CHAR(16) DEFAULT 'unlisted';
    ```
+ _declare keys_ 
    + _approach_ 
        + declare one attribute to be a key when attribute is listed in the schema
        ```sql 
        // unique name and cannot be NULL
        CREATE TABLE MovieStart (
            name CHAR(30) PRIMARY KEY,
            address VARCHAR(250),
            gender CHAR(1),
            birthdate DATE
        );
        ```
        + add to the list of tems declared in the schema an additional declaration that says a particular attribute or set of attributes forms the key
            + used when key consists of more than 1 attribute
        ```sql 
        CREATE TABLE Movies (
            title CHAR(100),
            year INT,
            length INT, 
            genre CHAR(10),
            studioName CHAR(30),
            producerC# INT,
            PRIMARY KEY (title, year)
        );
        ```
    + `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE`
        + 2 tuples in `R` cannot agree on all of the attributes in set `S` unless one of them is `NULL`
        + attempts to insert/update a tuple that violates this rule causes DBMS to reject action that caused the violation
        + _additionaly for `PRIMARY KEY`_ 
            + attributes in `S` are not allowd to have `NULL` as value for their components
