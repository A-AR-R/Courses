ER model notes


+ _entity set_ 
    + category of objects having properties in common 
    + _entity_ 
        + an instance of an entity set
+ _relationship sets_ 
    + an association between 2+ entity sets
    + _relation_ 
        + an instance of n-ary relationship set
    + _recursive relationships_ 
        + i.e. _colleagues_ with 2 lines connect to _employee_
    + _ternary relationships_ 
        + intersection with 3 lines pointing to 3 entity sets
+ _attributes_ 
    + elementary properties of entities or relationships
    + _types_ 
        + single-valued
            + solid circle
            + usually cardinality `(1,1)` 
                + in this case dont need to label, omitted
        + multi-valued
            + a line and a knob
    + _composite attributes_ 
        + grouped attributes of the same entity or relationship that have closely connected meaning or uses
+ _cardinalities_ 
    + constraint how entity instances participates in relationship instances
    + `(min, max)`s pairs
    + `min`
        + 0: entity participation optional 
        + 1: mandatory 
        + ...
    + `max`
        + 1: each instance of entity associated with at most a single instance of the relationship
        + >1: each intance of entity can be associated multiple instances of the relationship
        + N: indicate no upper limit
+ _multiplicity of relationships_ 
    + relationship `R` has participating entities with carbinalities
        + `(a,A)`
        + `(b,B)`
    + so multiplicity of `R` is `A`-to-`B`
+ _keys_ 
    + minimal sets of attributes which uniquely identify instances of an entity set 
    + _interval key_ 
        + 1 or more attributes of the entity itself
    + _weak entity_ 
        + entity that doesnt have a key among its attributes
        + key of related entities brought in to help (i.e. becoming _foreign key_)
    + _observations_ 
        + constituting attributes has `(1,1)` cardinality
        + for foreign keys
            + the owning relationship participate in relationship with cardinality of `(1,1)`

__From model to ER schema__

+ _remove reduandancy_ 
+ _entity sets vs. attributes_  
    + _entity set_ satisfy at least 1 of 
        + has at least 1 non-key attribute
        + the _many_ in a many-one or many-many relationship
    + about removing redundancy
+ _limit use of weak entity set_
+ _select a primary key_  
    + criteria
        + attributes that cannot be null
        + fewer attributes the better
        + internal keys better than external ones
    + _the bad_
        + multi-attribute and/or string keys
    + _multi-valued attributes_
        + not allowed 
        + must convert those to entity set, (connected to via a relationship set)


__Translating ER model to DB schema__

+ goal  
    + not allow redundancy 
    + exclude unnecessary null values 
+ idea
    + entity set becomes relation
        + attributes as attributes of the entity set
    + relationship set becomes relation 
        + attributes as 
            + keys of entity sets that it connects, plus
            + attributes of the relatioship itself.
+ _observation_ 
    + _relationship set_ 
        + keys of relationship set are themselves foreign keys to the participating entity set
        + for `min=0` case, just means an entry is missing,
        + for `min=1` case, just means 
            + there is an additional referential constraint in the opposite direction as the `min=0` case
            + in this case, primary key of participating entity set (with `min=1`) are foreign keys to partial key of the relationship set
    + `(1,1)` case
        + can remove this relation by incorporating the relationship set to the entity set
+ _Many-to-Many_ 
    + _binary_ 
    + _recursive_ 
    + _ternary_ 
+ _One-to-Many_
    + _with mandatory participation on one side_
+ _One-to-One_
    + optional participation for one
