```sql
-- insert
create table Ages(name TEXT, age INT)
insert into Ages values
    ('Amna', 21), ('Zach', 25), ('Miriam', NULL), ('Ben', 0);
```

```sql
-- insert computed value
insert into Ages 
    (select distinct firstname, 19 as age
    from Student join Took using (sID)
                 join Offering using (oID)
    where cnum <= 199);
```


```sql 
-- insert with default value 
create table Invite (
    name TEXT, 
    campus TEXT DEFAULT 'StG',
    email TEXT, 
    age INT
);
```


```sql
-- DBMS fills in missing attributes, i.e. campus and age
-- since campus has default value, `StG` is used, 
-- age does not have default value, so `NULL` is used
insert into Invite(name, email)
    (select firstname, email
    from Student 
    where cgpa > 3.4);
```

```sql 
-- deletion rows satisfying a condition
delete from Took 
where grade < 50;

-- delete all rows
delete from Took;
```

```sql
-- change values with UPDATE
-- UPDATE <table> SET <attrs...> WHERE <condition>;
update Student 
set campus = 'UTM'
where sID = 99999;
```


```sql 
-- update many rows 
update Took 
set grade = 100
where sID = 99132 and grade > 32 and grade < 100;
```

```sql 
SELECT *
  FROM users
 WHERE email = 'user@email.com'
   AND pass  = 'password'' LIMIT 1
```

```sql

  FROM users
 WHERE email = 'user@email.com'
   AND pass  = '' or 1=1--' LIMIT 1
