#### Intro INFO


[__Tauopathies__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauopathy)  
Neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of tau proteins in the human brain. A great example of the disease is Alzheimer's disease, caused by the hyperphosphorylation of a microtubule associated protein known as tau. In AD, tau protein is deposited within neurons in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

Tau protein provide structural supports for neural microtubules. Tauopathy is when they clump to one another instead of to the neuron structure  


[__Tau Proteins__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein)     
Tau proteins are proteins that __stabilize microtubules__. They are abundant in neurons of the central nervous system and are less common elsewhere. Pathologies and dementias of the nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are associated with tau proteins that have become defective and no longer stabilize microtubules properly. The tau proteins are the product of _alternative splicing_ from a single gene that in humans is designated __MAPT__ (microtubule-associated protein tau) and is located on chromosome 17.

Tau protein is a highly soluble __microtubule-associated protein__ (MAP). Other nervous system MAPs may perform similar functions, as suggested by tau knockout mice that did not show abnormalities in brain development - possibly because of compensation in tau deficiency by other MAPs. Tau is not present in dendrites and is active primarily in the distal portions of axons where it provides microtubule stabilization but also flexibility as needed. Tau proteins interact with tubulin to stabilize microtubules and _promote tubulin assembly_ into microtubules. Tau has two ways of controlling microtubule stability: __isoforms__ and __phosphorylation__.   

_Structure_  
Six tau isoforms exist in human brain tissue, and they are distinguished by their number of binding domains. Three isoforms have three binding domains and the other three have four binding domains. The isoforms are a result of alternative splicing in exons 2, 3, and 10 of the tau gene. Tau is a phosphoprotein with _79_ potential Serine (Ser) and Threonine (Thr) phosphorylation sites on the longest tau isoform. __Phosphorylation__ of tau is regulated by a host of kinases, including PKN, a serine/threonine kinase. When PKN is activated, it phosphorylates tau, resulting in disruption of microtubule organization. Phosphorylation of tau is also developmentally regulated. For example, fetal tau is more highly phosphorylated in the embryonic CNS than adult tau. The degree of phosphorylation in all six isoforms decreases with age due to the activation of phosphatases. Like kinases, phosphatases too play a role in regulating the phosphorylation of tau.    

_Hyperphosphorylation_
Hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein (tau inclusions, pTau) can result in the __self-assembly__ of tangles of paired helical filaments and straight filaments, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other tauopathies. All of the six tau isoforms are present in an often __hyperphosphorylated state__ in paired helical filaments from Alzheimer's disease brain. In other neurodegenerative diseases, the deposition of aggregates enriched in certain tau isoforms has been reported. When misfolded, this otherwise very soluble protein can form extremely __insoluble aggregates__ that contribute to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The tau hypothesis states that excessive or abnormal phosphorylation of tau results in the transformation of normal adult tau into PHF-tau (paired helical filament) and NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles).

> Mutations that alter function and isoform expression of tau lead to hyperphosphorylation.

[__Huntington's Disease__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease)
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to mental decline and behavioral symptoms. There is no cure for HD.


_Genetics_    
The disease is caused by an __autosomal dominant mutation__ in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin(__HTT__), which codes for protein Huntingtin(__Htt__). Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat of __CAG__(cytosine-adenine-guanine), which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a __polyglutamine tract__ (or polyQ tract). When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (__mHtt__). The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease.

![alt mHtt and Htt](http://bio116su12.pbworks.com/f/1340578553/11MML010_huntingtons_disease_LR.jpg)  


_Functions_  
Htt is important for __embryonic development__, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an __anti-apoptotic agent__ preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. Htt also facilitates __vesicular transport__ and __synaptic transmission__ and controls neuronal gene __transcription__. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of Htt, but by a gain of toxic function of mHtt.

![alt tau Disruption](http://www.nature.com/nrneurol/journal/v10/n4/images_article/nrneurol.2014.24-f5.jpg)  

_Pathogenesis_  
Mutant huntingtin (mHtt) leads to several neuronal and glial alterations, including notable transcriptional, mitochondrial and axonal transport defects, ultimately leading to neuronal death, primarily in striatal and cortical areas. __Cleavage__ of the protein can leave behind shorter fragments constituted of parts of the polyglutamine expansion.

> The polar nature of glutamine causes interactions with other proteins when it is overabundant in unmodified Htt proteins or the Htt fragments created from Htt cleavage.

Thus, the mHtt molecule strands will form hydrogen bonds with one another, forming a __protein aggregate__ rather than folding into functional proteins. Over time, the aggregates accumulate, ultimately interfering with neuron function because these fragments can then misfold and coalesce, in a process called protein aggregation, to form __inclusion bodies__ within cells.


[__Huntingtin__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin)  
The huntingtin gene, also called the HTT or HD (Huntington disease) gene, is the __IT15__ ("interesting transcript 15") gene, which codes for a protein called the __huntingtin protein__. The exact function of this protein is not known, but it plays an important role in nerve cells. Within cells, huntingtin may be involved in __signaling__, __transporting materials__, __binding__ proteins and other structures, and __protecting against__ programmed cell death (apoptosis). The huntingtin protein is essential for normal __development__ before birth. It is expressed in many tissues in the body, with the highest levels of expression seen in the brain. From immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation studies of the molecule, it has been found that huntingtin is primarily __associated with vesicles and microtubules__. These appear to indicate a functional role in __cytoskeletal anchoring__ or __transport of mitochondria__.

[__Inclusion Bodies__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_bodies)  
Inclusion bodies are nuclear or cytoplasmic aggregates of stainable substances, usually proteins. There is a growing body of information indicating that formation of inclusion bodies occurs as a result of intracellular accumulation of __partially folded expressed proteins__ which aggregate through non-covalent hydrophobic or ionic interactions or a combination of both.

[__Filter Binding assay__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_binding_assay)  
In biochemistry or chemistry, one of the ways to learn about an interaction between two molecules is to determine the binding constant, which is a number that describes the ratio of unbound and bound molecules. This information reveals the affinity between the two molecules and allows prediction of the amount bound given any set of initial conditions.

A filter binding assay measures affinities between __two molecules__ (often protein and DNA) using a filter. The filter is constructed of __nitrocellulose paper__, which is negatively charged. Since most proteins have a net positive charge, nitrocellulose paper is ideal for immobilizing proteins. __DNA__ is negatively charged due to the phosphate backbone and __will not "stick"__ to the nitrocellulose on its own, however, any DNA that has been __bound by protein__ will __stick__. The exact amount of DNA "stuck" to the nitrocellulose is quantified by measuring the amount of radioactivity on the filter using a scintillation counter.

Recently, filtration methods have been used to quantify the products of __protein aggregation reactions__. In this approach, reaction products are filtered through a membrane that traps and retains large protein aggregates while small species including protein monomers pass through. When combined with solid-phase immunodetection, the approach can yield a highly sensitive estimation of protein aggregation


[__Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Assay__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimolecular_fluorescence_complementation)  
Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (also known as __BiFC__) is a technology typically used to __validate protein interactions__. It is based on the association of fluorescent protein fragments that are attached to components of the same macromolecular complex. Proteins that are postulated to interact are fused to unfolded complementary fragments of a fluorescent reporter protein and expressed in live cells. Interaction of these proteins will bring the fluorescent fragments within __proximity__, allowing the reporter protein to reform in its native three-dimensional structure and emit its fluorescent signal.

![BiFC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Final_copy.jpg)  

In BiFC assays, the proteins of interest are fused to two non-fluorescent halves of a fluorescent reporter protein. When the proteins of interest dimerize/oligomerize, the two reporter halves are brought together and reconstitute the fluorophore, emitting fluorescence.  

> Fluorescence is therefore indicative of dimerization/oligomerization.
