#### Opening summary


Genes and Omics combine to form genomics. EGFR inhibitors and AML drug drives the development endeavor related to genetics and disease. TCGA gradually unfolds. Single gene therapeutics are the golden grail of modern genomics. Tension between pathology who characterize cancer types with morphology with current sequencing efforts.

#### Molecular histopathological and morphological features in breast cancer Yu Jing Jan Heng

Clustering of morphological features driven by mutations in tp53 and amplification in 12p13.3, 8q24. Morphological features associated with PAM50 luminal A or basal like. Enriched gene set clustered morphological features into proliferation or inflammation. Metabric is a good database for oncology. __Epithelial Tubule__ formation associated with survival. morphological features may have underlie genomic transcriptomic and proteomic basis.There is a [database](www.pathology.ai/tcga_breast)



#### Molecular diagnosis for pediatric cancer through integrative analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, and transcriptome sequencing  Jinghui Zhang

Identify clinically-relevant pathogenic mutations. Pediatric cancer genome project (PCGP) paired tumor-normal whole-genome sequencing. Germ line mutation in cancer predisposition genes. Identified pathologic mutation in 8.5% of pediatric patient, tp53 is the most highly mutated. The importance is clinical translation. A pilot validation study assess the ability to identify diagnostic lesion. Integrated analysis is very complicated. detection of indel using whole exome sequencing does not have high coverage.

#### The landscape of tumor mutation load across the entire spectrum of human cancer derived from 60000 patients Garett Frampton  

mutation burden (TMB) is a biomarker for response to PD-1 inhibitors. Comprehensive genomic profiling assay workflow. The landscape of TMB in 60000 clinical cases. Since there are always some cases where there is high level of TMB, which may be applicable in the context of immunotherapy. Recurrent mutation in promoter of PMS2 associated with increased TMB.

#### integration of tumor microenvironment and molecular subclassfication of colorectal cancer identifies patient subsets with poor prognosis Jesper Bramsen

Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Reduce heterogeneity by subclassfication into archetypes. RNAseq of 300 patients and use NMF-clustering produce 3 cancer archetypes. stromal transcript results in 5 tumor archetypes. Characterization of experimental and bioinformatics analysis. separating of CRC to secretaryk, serrated, and absorptive cancer type. 5 types if stromal transcript included; this subtyping have significant survival outcome. Tumor microenvironment may therefore affecting subtypng.

#### Restriction on access to systemic therapy limit the application of WGS in clinical care  Janessa Laskin

Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) clinical trial for incurable cancers with whole genome sequencing.
