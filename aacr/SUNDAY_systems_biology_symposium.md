#### Novel and Integrative analyses of Cancer Genome Data

Thousands of tumors continue to be profiled using multiple genomic and proteomic platforms.

__1__ _Improving T-cell receptor clonotyping using hybrid catpure and NGS_   
Facts
+ T cell receptor is the interface of adaptive immune system to interat with antigen
+ present on cell surface membrane
+ splicing inconsistencies and introduction and addition of nucleotides introduce genetic variation to increase variability of TCR antigen specificity.

TCR clonotyping is a molecular description of antigen specificity
+ type alpha/beta theta/gamma
+ enumerate V and J genes
+ define DCR3 AA sequence

TCR clonotyping in silico
+ single-cell sequencing
+ population level clonotype is possible but provides a snapshot of the dominant type.

BIOMED: the current diagnostic standard.

Hybrid capture: subtract primer from mix.


__2__

Tumor immune environment:
+ TIL
+ IHC
+ flow cytometry
+ sequencing

T-cell repertoire diversity
+ oligoclonal T cell or polyclonal T cell
+ CDR3 multiplex PCR and sequencing

mapping exome CDR3 reads using TCGA datasets
+ ability to perform full length alignment if constructing a library of combination of CDR3
+ looked at 1000 tumors with CDR3 reads.
+ looked at adaptive immunity gene expression signatures
+ CDR3 reads is a good indicator of survival in HER2+

__3__ _proteogenomic analysis of alternative splicing, in colorectal cancer_
Population wide screening for colorectal cancer implemented in Netherlands. Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is used and may lead to colonoscopy if FIT+. The goal is to identify biomarkers for CRC screening.

With use of available protein database, ~50% of mass spectra are still not identified. To increase this percentage, use RNA-seq, in the context of downregulation alternative sequencing using miRNA.

__4__ _improved geometric deconvolution of bulk tumor data_               

__5__ _Comprehensive genome and transcriptome analsis of breast cancer cell line_

SK-BR-3: most commonly used cell line.
