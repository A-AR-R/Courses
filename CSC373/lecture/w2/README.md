+ _greedy algorithms_ 
    + makes locally optimal choices in hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution
    + for optimization problems

+ _activity-selection problem_ 
    + scheduling of several competing activities requiring exclusive use of a common resource, with the goal of selecting a maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities
        + Given set $S = \{ a_1,a_1, \cdots, a_n\}$, of `n` _activities_ whishing to use a resource, which can serve one activity at a time.
        + start time `s_i` and end time `f_i`
