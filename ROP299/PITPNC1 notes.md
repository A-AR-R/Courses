## METHODOLOGY
**transfection** Transfection is the process of deliberately introducing nucleic acids into cells. The term is often used for non-viral methods in eukaryotic cells. "transformation" is more often used to describe non-viral DNA transfer in bacteria and non-animal eukaryotic cells.

**viral transduction**<br>Transduction is the process by which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus. It also refers to the process whereby foreign DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector. Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host cell's genome.

**lipofection**<br>Lipofection (or liposome transfection) is a technique used to inject genetic material into a cell by means of liposomes, which are vesicles that can easily merge with the cell membrane since they are both made of a phospholipid bilayer. Lipofection generally uses a positively charged (cationic) lipid to form an aggregate with the negatively charged (anionic) genetic material. A net positive charge on this aggregrate has been assumed to increase the effectiveness of transfection through the negatively charged phospholipid bilayer. This transfection technology performs the same tasks as other biochemical procedures utilizing polymers, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate, and electroporation. The main advantages of lipofection are its high efficiency, its ability to transfect all types of nucleic acids in a wide range of cell types, its ease of use, reproducibility, and low toxicity. In addition, this method is suitable for all transfection applications (transient, stable, co-transfection, reverse, sequential or multiple transfections). High throughput screening assay has also shown good efficiency in some in vivo models.

Lipofectamine or [Lipofectamine 2000] ([http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/10462023/v33i0002/95_atwl2rpnsaha.xml](http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/10462023/v33i0002/95_atwl2rpnsaha.xml)) is a common transfection reagent, produced and sold by Invitrogen, used in molecular and cellular biology. It is used to increase the transfection efficiency of RNA (including mRNA and siRNA) or plasmid DNA into in vitro cell cultures by lipofection.Lipofectamine reagent contains lipid subunits that can form liposomes in an aqueous environment, which entrap the transfection materials, i.e. DNA plasmids.

[**Comparative Genomic Hybridization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization) CGC is a molecular cytogenetic method for analysing copy number variations (CNVs) relative to ploidy level in the DNA of a test sample compared to a reference sample, without the need for culturing cells. This technique was originally developed for the evaluation of the differences between the chromosomal complements of solid tumor and normal tissue, and has an improved resoIution of 5-10 megabases compared to the more traditional cytogenetic analysis techniques of giemsa banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which are limited by the resolution of the microscope utilized.This is achieved through the use of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization. In short, this involves the isolation of DNA from the two sources to be compared, most commonly a test and reference source, independent labelling of each DNA sample with a different fluorophores (fluorescent molecules) of different colours (usually red and green), denaturation of the DNA so that it is single stranded, and the hybridization of the two resultant samples in a 1:1 ratio to a normal metaphase spread of chromosomes, to which the labelled DNA samples will bind at their locus of origin. Using a fluorescence microscope and computer software, the differentially coloured fluorescent signals are then compared along the length of each chromosome for identification of chromosomal differences between the two sources. A higher intensity of the test sample colour in a specific region of a chromosome indicates the gain of material of that region in the corresponding source sample, while a higher intensity of the reference sample colour indicates the loss of material in the test sample in that specific region. A neutral colour (yellow when the fluorophore labels are red and green) indicates no difference between the two samples in that location. Preferentially, DNA should be extracted from fresh or frozen tissue as this will be of the highest quality, though it is now possible to use archival material which is formalin fixed or paraffin wax embedded, provided the appropriate procedures are followed. 0.5-1 µg of DNA is sufficient for the CGH experiment, though if the desired amount is not obtained _DOP-PCR_ may be applied to amplify the DNA, however it in this case it is important to apply DOP-PCR to both the test and reference DNA samples to improve reliability.

[**Whole-Genome Amplification by Single-Cell Comparative Genomic Hybridization PCR (SCOMP)**](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2008/1/pdb.prot4923.long)<br>PCR-based whole-genome amplification (WGA) has the goal of generating microgram quantities of genome-representative DNA from picogram or nanogram amounts of starting material. This amplification should introduce little, or ideally no, representational bias. Ligation-mediated PCR techniques involve ligating an adaptor sequence onto a "representation" of DNA molecules, generated following enzymatic digestion, random shearing, or chemical cleavage. Single-cell comparative genomic hybridization (SCOMP), described in this protocol, is a form of ligation-mediated PCR that was specifically designed for WGA of extremely limited sources of genomic DNA. SCOMP begins by converting the genome to a high-complexity representation with a fragment size of <2 kb by digesting with the restriction enzyme MseI. Following enzyme digestion, adaptors containing specific primer sequences (specific to the restriction enzyme used) are ligated onto the ends of the genomic DNA and amplified in a high-stringency PCR. This results in a smear of PCR products in the range of 100-1500 bp, which can be visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis.

[**MDA-MB-231**](http://www.atcc.org/Products/All/HTB-26.aspx)<br>MDA-MB-231, an adenocarcinoma, was isolated from pleural effusions of a female Caucasian breast cancer patient. It is adherent and epithelial. It is a basal (triple negative) aggressive metastatic breast cancer cell line. It is unresponsive to chemotherapy. This cell line harbors 5 mutations which are: TP53, BRAF, CDN2A, KRAS and NF2. They are mesenchymal in shape.

[**MCF-7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7)<br>MCF-7 is a breast cancer cell line isolated in 1970 from a 69-year-old Caucasian woman. MCF-7 is the acronym of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7, referring to the institute in Detroit where the cell line was established in 1973 by Herbert Soule and co-workers. It is derived from primary invasive ductal carcinoma via pleural effusion. It has estrogen, progesteron on its surface but not overexpression of ERBB2 gene, therefore belongs to the _luminal A_ subtype. It has an epithelial phenotype and is _not metastatic_.

[**trans-well migration assay**]()<br>The transwell migration assay is a commonly used test to study the migratory response of endothelial cells to angiogenic inducers or inhibitors. This assay is also known as the Boyden or modified Boyden chamber assay. During this assay, endothelial cells are placed on the upper layer of a cell permeable membrane and a solution containing the test agent is placed below the cell permeable membrane. Following an incubation period (3–18 hours), the cells that have migrated through the membrane are stained and counted. The membrane is usually coated with some extracellular matrix component (e.g. collagen) which facilitates both adherence and migration. The upper chamber of Transwell has 8 micronpores. Approximately 150,000 cells will be plated. Detailed [protocol](http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/52#/procedure) here.

[**hemocytometer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocytometer)<br>The hemocytometer is a device used to count cells. It was originally designed for the counting of blood cells.<br>The hemocytometer was invented by Louis-Charles Malassez and consists of a thick glass microscope slide with a rectangular indentation that creates a chamber. This chamber is engraved with a laser-etched grid of perpendicular lines. The device is carefully crafted so that the area bounded by the lines is known, and the depth of the chamber is also known. It is therefore possible to count the number of cells or particles in a specific volume of fluid, and thereby calculate the concentration of cells in the fluid overall.

## Introduction
gene function, related cancer research related to PITPNC1. Why study this gene to begin with, what is its significance. How to study it. Indicating purpose of the study

**Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITP)** Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein ([PITP](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR001666)) is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein, thought to be involved in transport of phospholipids from their site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to other cell membranes. More recently, PITP has been shown to be an essential component of the polyphosphoinositide _synthesis machinery_ and is hence required for proper signalling by epidermal growth factor and f-Met-Leu-Phe, as well as for exocytosis. The role of PITP in polyphosphoinositide synthesis may also explain its involvement in intracellular vesicular traffic. [Specifically](http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00928674/v81i0005/659_stamttpc.xml), it is hypothesized that PITP is required for Ptdlns(4,5)P2 synthesis and that its function is to present Ptdlns to Ptdlns 4-kinase (Kauffmann-Zeh et al., 1995). phosphoinositide synthesis is linked to a variety of membrane traffic events. Ptdlns(3)P is specifically synthesized for use in membrane trafficking while Ptdlns(3,4)P2 and Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 may be used for a different function in mammalian cells. While in mammalian cells Ptdlns(3)P is constitutively produced, Ptdlns(3,4)P2 and Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 are produced acutely in response to agents that activate tyrosine kinases. It may be predicted that PITP serves to present Ptdlns to those phosphoinositide kinases that are involved in trafficking, the same as it does for phosphoinositide kinases involved in signaling

**Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, cytoplasmic 1 (PITPNC1 or RdgBβ)**<br>This [gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26207) encodes a member of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein family. The encoded _cytoplasmic_ protein plays a role in multiple processes including cell signaling and lipid metabolism by facilitating the transfer of phosphatidylinositol between membrane compartments. It is locaated on 17q24.2, consisting of 11 exons and 332 AA long. PITPNC1 [(UNIPROT)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UKF7#section_comments) mediate the monomeric transport of lipids by shielding a lipid from the aqueous environment and binding the lipid in a hydrophobic cavity. Able to transfer phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Belongs to the _PtdIns transfer protein family_ PI transfer class IIB subfamily. 2 isoforms of the human protein are produced by alternative splicing. It may be involved in polyphosphoinositide synthesis which is required for proper signaling by _epidermal growth factor_ (which stimulates cell growth proliferation, induced in tumor cells) and f-Met-Leu-Phe as well as exocytosis. Metazoan PITPs are ubiquitous, 35-kDa soluble proteins that catalyze the transfer of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)1 and phosphatidylcholine between membrane bilayers (1, 2). Human cells contain two closely related PITP isoforms, PITPa and PITPb (77% identity). Reconstitution studies indicated that PITPs play an essential role in the _biosynthesis_ of PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate during phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase mediated signal transduction and exocytosis[ref](http://www.jbc.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/content/274/44/31553.full.pdf+html).

![alt PITP classification](http://www.jbc.org/content/287/38/32263/F1.large.jpg)

[_domain organization of PITP family members_] ([http://www.jbc.org/content/287/38/32263/F1.expansion.html](http://www.jbc.org/content/287/38/32263/F1.expansion.html))

[**BINDING PROPERTY**] ([http://www.jbc.org/content/287/38/32263.full](http://www.jbc.org/content/287/38/32263.full))<br> PI transfer activity of RdgBβ-sp1 is low when compared with PITPα. The PITP domain of Class II PITPs can bind phosphatidytic acid(PA) in addition to binding PI and PC. Thus, the lipid binding properties of Class II PITPs differ from those of Class I PITPs. A striking feature of human RdgBβ is their inability to bind substantial amounts of phosphotidylcholine. Because RdgBα proteins also bind PA, it is possible that they are responsible for PA transfer at intermembrane contact sites. Because PA can be metabolized into DAG, RdgBα proteins could possibly regulate the availability of DAG.

[**mir-126**]  ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir-126](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir-126))<br>In molecular biology mir-126 is a short non-coding RNA molecule. MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several pre- and post-transcription mechanisms. mir-126 is a human microRNA that is expressed only in endothelial cells, throughout capillaries as well as larger blood vessels, and acts upon various transcripts to control _angiogenesis_. miRNA binds to target sequences reducing the expression of the target gene. miRNA can bind either directly to DNA preventing transcription or to transcribed mRNA preventing translation and directing the mRNA for degradation. mir-126, a _tumor suppressor_, is reduced in breast cancer. It also suppresses metastatic endothelial recruitment, angiogenesis and colonisation, through interaction with its target genes IGFBP2, _PITPNC1_, and MERTK.

[**A microRNA regulon that mediates endothelial recruitment and metastasis by cancer cells**](http://getit.library.utoronto.ca.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/oneclick?sid=Entrez:PubMed&id=pmid:22170610)<br>We previously identified a set of human microRNAs (miRNAs) that robustly suppress breast cancer metastasis to lung and bone and which display expression levels that predict human metastasis. Here we reveal that endogenous miR-126, an miRNA silenced in a variety of common human cancers, non-cell-autonomously regulates _endothelial cell recruitment_ to metastatic breast cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. It suppresses metastatic endothelial recruitment, metastatic angiogenesis and metastatic colonization through coordinate targeting of IGFBP2, PITPNC1 and MERTK-novel pro-angiogenic genes and biomarkers of human metastasis. Specifically, miR-126 interact with the coding region of PITPNC1. And that knockdown of PITPNC1 _significantly suppressed the ability of metastatic LM2 and CN34-LM1A cells to recruit endothelial cells_, whereas their overexpression in MDA-231 and CN34-Par cells enhanced endothelial recruitment. Importantly, knockdown of these genes did not significantly decrease cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, expression levels of IGFBP2, MERTK and PITPNC1 were individually and significantly increased in patients with stage III and IV primary tumours relative to those with stage I and II tumours in an additional cohort of 96 patients. Knockdown of PITPNC1 strongly inhibited metastatic colonization. Also, knockdown of the miR-126 target gene PITPNC1 reduced IGFBP2 secretion from breast cancer cells. Patients whose tumors had higher expression of PITPNC1 were more prone to relapse.

> _Metastatic cancer_ cells have the ability to recruit blood vessel cells -- they send out multiple signals that cause endothelial cells to arrive at the incipient metastatic site

[**Phosphatidylinositol**] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol))

[**Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)**] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol_(3,4,5)-trisphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol_(3,4,5)-trisphosphate))<br>PIP3 is the _product_ of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) phosphorylation of _phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)_. It is a phospholipid that resides on the plasma membrane. PIP3 functions to activate downstream signaling components, the most notable one being the protein kinase **AKT**, which activates downstream anabolic signaling pathways required for cell growth and survival. Phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to produce inositol triphosphate IP3, and diacylglycerol.

![alt PIP3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Phosphatidylinositol-3%2C4%2C5-trisphosphate.svg)

[**Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)**] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase))<br>PI3K is a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer.PI3Ks are a family of related intracellular signal transducer enzymes capable of phosphorylating the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). The pathway, with oncogene **PIK3CA** and tumor suppressor **PTEN,** is implicated in insensitivity of cancer tumors to insulin and IGF1, and in calorie restriction.  

[**phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha**] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P110%CE%B1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P110%CE%B1))   or P110α is a class I PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit. The human p110α protein is encoded by the PIK3CA gene. It is found to be mutated in a variety of cancers and implicated in cervical cancer.

![alt P100a](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/PI3kinase.png)

[**Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)**] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)))<br>Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the PTEN gene. Mutations of this gene are a step in the development of many cancers. This gene was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. The protein encoded by this gene is a **phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase**,a tyrosine phosphatase. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating Akt/PKB signaling pathway. During tumor development, mutations and deletions of PTEN occur that inactivate its enzymatic activity leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death.

[**AKT/PKB pathway**] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akt/PKB_signaling_pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akt/PKB_signaling_pathway))<br>The Akt Pathway, or PI3K-Akt Pathway is a signal transduction pathway that promotes survival and growth in response to extracellular signals. Key proteins involved are _phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase_ (PI3K) and Akt, or _Protein Kinase B_.Initial stimulation by a growth factor causes activation of a cell surface receptor and phosphorylation of PI3K. Activated PI3K then phosphorylates lipids on the plasma membrane, forming _second messenger_ phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is recruited to the membrane by interaction with these phosphoinositide _docking sites_, so that it can be fully activated. Activated Akt mediates downstream responses, including cell survival, growth, proliferation, cell migration and angiogenesis, by phosphorylating a range of intracellular proteins. The pathway is present in all cells of higher eukaryotes and is highly conserved. These phosphorylated lipids are anchored to the plasma membrane, where they can directly bind intracellular proteins containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) or FYVE domain. For example, the triphosphate form _(PI(3,4,5)P3)_ binds Akt and _phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1_ (PDK1) so they accumulate in close proximity at the membrane. The Akt-PI3K pathway is essential for cell survival as activated Akt influences many factors involved in apoptosis, either by transcription regulation or direct phosphorylation. In the nucleus, Akt inhibits transcription factors that promote the expression of cell death genes, and enhances transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. Additionally, Akt promotes G1-S phase cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) at Ser9. Akt both indirectly and directly regulates _cyclin-dependent kinase_ (CDK) inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 , allowing cell cycle progression. Akt phosphorylates p27kip1 at Thr157, preventing its nuclear import. In terms of cell migration,   Akt phosphorylates many proteins involved in polymerisation and stabilisation of the actin cytoskeleton. In normal cells, this can either increase the stability of cytoskeleton components or promote migration via remodelling.  

![alt akt/pkb](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/P13K-Akt_Pathway_Activated_by_RTK.png)

Aberrant activation of Akt, either via PI3K or independently of PI3K, is often associated with malignancy. Studies have identified gene amplification of the Akt isoforms in many types of cancer, including glioblastoma, ovarian, pancreatic and breast cancers. In addition to its effects on cell survival and cell cycle progression, the PI3K-Akt pathway promotes other characteristics of cancer cells. Hyperactivity of the pathway promotes the **epithelial-mesenchymal transition** (EMT) and metastasis due to its effects on cell migration. This allows spreading of the primary tumour to other sites and is responsible for 90% of mortalities linked to cancer.

**Purpose**
- To verify the role of PITPNC1 in breast cancer progression, specifically the transition from DCIS to IDC that is predisposed to metastasis.   
- Selection of genes for anti-cancer drugs  
- Identification of diagnostic markers for prognosis and conventional treatment stratification  
- Study done before that compare pure DCIS to iaklov paper   
  - DCIS associated with IDC   
  - IDC with lymph node metastasis   
  - IDC without lymph node metastasis    

Studies done before o.    Overexpresison on chromosome 17 (17q23.3-24.3) were associated with positive HER2/neu, histologic grade, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and poorer prognosis compared to other altered genes from microarray data. (p<0.05) p.    Dissimilarity between pure DCIS and DCIS associated with IDC. Paired DCIS and IDC showed similar genomic profiles. Therefore DCIS associated with IDC may represent a pre-invasive clone with high invasive potential chunjie paper q.    No significant differences in copy number for genes (using multiplex pcr-based test) between DCIS and adjacent IDC ----DCIS is as advanced as its invasive counterpart 5 r.    DCIS is the widely accepted precursor of IDC. Whole exome sequencing and copy number profiling of pure DCIS and synchronous DCIS and IDC. Found no recurrent nor significantly mutated genes with synchronous DCIS-IDC (categorized together because their genomic profile is remarkably similar) compared to pure DCIS. Progression of DCIS to IDC may be the result of several mutation driver event. Also, IDC associated DCIS is more aggressive than pure DCIS at genomic level and should really be considered IDC. For similar levels of PITPNC1 in 2 cases, it makes sense. But since PITPNC1 is expressed in similar levels, cross different clinipathological conditions, PITPNC1 may be the driver gene from normal to DCIS. (PMC4480702) hypothesize that PITPNC1 may be a component of driver mutations that promote detachment/metastasis phenotype s.     Effect of Abi1 gene overexpression in gastric cancer cell proliferation in vitro(PMID: 20193272) t.    Cancer is attributable to accumulation of mutations. To understand cancer progression is to identify genes whose alteration is responsible for the acquisition of metastatic potential in cancer cells. Tumor suppressor gene and oncogene correlate with aggressiveness of cancer. Need to identify causative mutations and resulting phenotypic alterations with respect to metastatic potential.   Pre-malignant lesions (monoclonal expansion of cells due to alteration) enable the accumulation of mutations. New clones with invasiveness and metastatic ability is only a small proportion of a heterogeneous primary tumor. Expect to see genetic alterations between invasive and non-metastatic cells i.    Identify genes whose mutation is accumulated during progression ii.    Identification of gene whose function is responsible for metastatic potential phenotype Genetic alterations accumulate in a step wise manner u.    HER2 is a marker for aggressiveness in breast cancer, PITPNC1 is usually HER2 positive v.    Breast cancer is heterogeneous spatially and temporally. It is multigenic. Relevant gene set to predict metastasis is important w.    Individualized prognosis necessary to evade the variability of sample based inferences. x.    Molecular subtyping provide a snapshot of tumor at any one time. However, tumor status changes as cancer progresses y.    Discordance in popular biomarkers such as HER2 (PMC3109557) raised question about treatment decision based on HER2 status in primary tumors z.    Thinking of predisposition to cancer by the identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene. Is this also true of PITPNC1 aa.    The goal is to capture clinically relevant signatures while getting rid of the noise due to tumor heterogeneity and disease complexity. The selection of genes has to be critically important to the survival of cancer genes. Important to link genetic signatures with specific patient group (PMC3109557)

questions:
1. DCIS can be easily detected with current knowledge, if PITPNC1 is the driver gene from normal to DCIS, what is its prognostic significance?
2. a.    Maybe associated with IDC since copy number is similar from qPCR results, but have to do more sample and test on that with a pool of controls.
3. The problem with this study is that we saw similar levels of PITPNC1 copy number in both the DCIS and IDC, meaning that it cannot be a reliable prognostic biomarker for cancer progression. The existence of estrogen receptor immunohistochemically staining and other related established method makes the detection of DCIS easily. Since the focus of cancer progression studies has been on detecting biomarker for invasion, it is really not necessary to develop another biomarker for identifying harmless and treatable DCIS cases. Also since it's a cytosolic protein, it might not be the best drug target as well, although I might contribute to the delivery and function of epidermal growth factor receptor.
4. ----- One hypothesis maybe that it promotes metastatic potential, gradually.
5. microRNA regulon mediates endothelial recruitment and metastasis by cancer cells(doi: 10.1038/nature10661). miRNA suppress metastatic phenotype, ex endothelial cell recruitment to metastatic breast cancer cells. miR-126 silenced in most of human cancers. miRNA suppresses metastatic endothelial recruitment, metastatic angiogenesis, and metastatic colonization.

Preliminary data showed that it is indeed amplified. But do not know if it is a sign of progression. Assay and data analysis for progressive stage of cancer should be done. Functional in vitro assays could also be done to verify its effect, see if it aids in proliferation and invasion.

So the only result that I can provide in the abstract is that PITPNC1 is indeed amplified, in both DCIS and IDC. I do not know if it is a sign of progression. So the only reasonable thing to write in the abstract would be that more assay and data analysis for progressive stage of cancer should be done. Functional in vitro assays could also be done to verify its effect in cell proliferation and invasion (adhesion).

Not only on the transcriptomic level is PITPNC1 amplified (by the silencing of miRNA), but also at the genomic level it is also amplified, consistently, however requires more sample, data points to infer its real significance, if there is a trend of increasing levels of amplification in cancer progression.
