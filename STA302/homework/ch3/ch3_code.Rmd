data <- read.table("airfares.txt", header=TRUE)

fit <- lm(Fare~Distance, data)
s <- summary(fit); s


plot(data$Distance, data$Fare)
par(mfrow=c(2,2)); plot(fit)

# residual vs fitted plot, 
#    indicates curlinear or another predictor missing from the model 
#    presence of unusual point 13
# qqplot 
#    heavy tailed
# residuals vs leverage plot
#    2 influential point 

# what to do
# remove point 13, since its unusual from residual vs fitted plot 
# should still keep point 17 even though it is influential, since it 
# reflects systematic pattern in the residual vs fitted plot 
# rest of data modeled with curvilinear relationship such as quadratic
