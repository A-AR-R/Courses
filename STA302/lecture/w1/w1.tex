\begin{defn*}
    The goal of \textbf{regression} is to summarize observed data as simply, usefully, and elegantly as possible. \textbf{Simple Linear Regression} has a summarizing model
    \[
        \E(Y | X = x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i 
    \]
    \[
        V(Y|X = x) = \sigma^2
    \]
    while making some error assumptions.
