`repeated`
```
(repeated f a n) → (listof A)
  f : (A -> A)
  a : A
  n : natural?
```
+ The list with elements `a, (f a), (f (f a)), ...,` of length n.
```
> (repeated sqr 2 3)
(list 2 4 16)
> (list 2 (sqr 2) (sqr (sqr 2)))
(list 2 4 16)
```
+ The Intermediate Step we show is:
    + `(repeated f a n) → (list a (f a) (f (f a)) ...)`



`big-bang`
```
(big-bang start                 ; model
          [on-tick updater]     ; controller
          [to-draw drawer])     ; view
```
+ Launch a window with an animation.
+ _conceptually_ 
    + The frames of the animation are the same as the images in the following list
        + `(map drawer (repeated updater start n))`
    + except big-bang does not actually create that list and goes on forever, 
        + not limited to generating some particular number of frames `n`.
+ _example_ 
    ```
    > (define (rotated-star angle)
        (rotate (* 15 angle) (star 25 "solid" "blue")))
    > (big-bang 0
                [on-tick add1]
                [to-draw rotated-star])
    ```
    + equivalent to `(map rotated-star (repeated add1 0 5))`


```
(big-bang start
          [on-tick updater])
```
+ _conceptually_ 
    + frames in animation are in the list `(repeated updater start n)`
    + idea is that have to put an image as `start`,...
    + whereas you can put arbitrary things and let `drawer` handle conversion from state to view


`map`

```
(map f l) → (listof Z)
  f : (A → Z)
  l : (listof A)
(map f l₁ l₂) → (listof Z)
  f : (A B → Z)
  l₁ : (listof A)
  l₂ : (listof B)
```
+ Performs a function on each value in a list, one at a time, separately, and gathers the resulting values into a list.
+ _steps_ 
    + `(map f (list a b c ...)) → (list (f a) (f b) (f c) ...)`
+ It can also be used with two lists of equal length, in which case it performs the function on pairs of elements from the two lists.
+ _steps_ 
    + `(map f (list a1 ... an) (list b1 ... bn)) → (list (f a1 b1) ... (f an bn))`




+ _tail call_ 
    + a subroutine call performed as the final action of the procedure
    + _tail call elimination_ 
        + can be implemented without adding a new _stack frame_ to _call stack_
        + frame for current procedure can be replaced by the frame of the tail call
        + _good_ 
            + allows procedure calls in tail position to be implemented as efficiently as `goto` statements (with `jump`)
            + allow tail recursion to use a similar amount of memory as an equivalent _loop_
        + mostly guaranteed by _functional programming language standards_
    + _tail position_ 
        ```java
        function bar(data) {
            if ( a(data) ) {
                return b(data);
            }
            return c(data);
        }
        ```
        + `b` and `c` are in tail position
        ```java
        function foo1(data) {
            return a(data) + 1;
        }
        function foo2(data) {
            var ret = a(data);
            return ret;
        }
        function foo3(data) {
            var ret = a(data);
            return (ret == 0) ? 1 : ret;
        }
        ```
        + `a` is in tail position for `foo2` but not `foo1` and `foo3`
            + since control must return to caller to inspect/modify before returning it
+ _tail recursive_ 
    + a _tail call_ that might lead to the _same subroutine_ being called again later in the call chain, the subroutine is said to be tail recursive
    + _tail recursion is a special case of recursion_
+ _tail-call optimization by language_ 
    + _yes_
        + js, scheme, racket, elixir, scala
    + _no_ 
        + python
