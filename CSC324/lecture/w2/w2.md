```
(apply f (list a b c ...)) → (f a b c ...)
```
+ `apply`
    + usually the _reduce_ part 
    + where `f` is a variadic function accepting arbitrary number of arguments

```
(map f (list a b c ...)) → (list (f a) (f b) (f c) ...)
```
+ `map`
    + process every element of the list
    + `f` has no restriction but the elements in list have to match signature of `f`

```
(cond [<condition-expression> <consequent-expression>]
        [else <alternative-expression>])
```
+ `cond`


```
(check-expect (expr) (expr))
```
+ `check-expect`
    + `#true` if expressions are equivalent


```
(append lists...)
```
+ `append`
    + append lists into one list
    + do nothing for empty list 


+ _referential transparency_ 
    + _expression_ is referentially transparent if 
        + if can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing program's behavior
    + _a referential transparent expression is deterministic_
    + _pure (referentially transparent) function_
        + functions that give the same value for same arguments
    + _note_ 
        + all math functions are referentially transparent 
        + functional programming, only referentially transparent functions are considered
    + _importance_ 
        + allows programmer/compiler to reason about program behavior as a rewrite system
        + can prove correctness, simply algorithm, and assits in code modification
+ _examples_ 
    + `getInput(src)` 
        + get IO input, different even for same arguments 
        + not deterministic and not referentially transparent 
    + _free variable_ 
        + a function that has a free variable, depends on some input that is not explicitly passed as parameter 
        + variables can be altered without changing values passed as parameter, results of function may differ even if parameters are identical
    + _arithmetic operations are referentially transparent_
    + _assignments are not transparent_ 
        + `x = x + 1` changes value assigned to `x`
        ```c 
        x = 10; 
        x = x + 1;      // 11
        x = x + 1;      // 12
        ```
        + _not transparent_
            + replace the value with `11` or `12` changes meaning of the program
        ```c
        int plusone(int x) {return x + 1;}
        x = plusone(x);
        ```
        + _`plusone` transparent_ 
            + will not change input `x` and has no side affects
