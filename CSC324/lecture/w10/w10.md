##### Monad

+ _monad_ 
    + a design pattern that defines how functions, actions and output scan be used together to build generic types
    + represents computations with a sequential structure:  
        + defines what it means to chain operations together
        + able to build pipelines that process data in a series of steps, 
    + defined by    
        + _type constructor `M`_
        + _return (unit) operator_     
            + creates values 
            + takes a value from a plain type `a` andn puts it into a container using constructor, creating a monadic value `M a`
        + _bind operator `>>=`_ 
            + link actions in the pipeline
            + takes as its arguments a monadic value with type `M a` and a function `a -> M b` that can transform the value
                + bind operator unwraps the plain value with type `a` embedded in its input monadic value with type `M a`, and feeds it to the function
                + the function then creates a new monadic value, with type `M b`, that can be fed to the next bind operator composed in the pipeline
            + can inject into the monadic value some additional information that is not accessible within the function, and pass it along.
            + or used to exert finer control over control flow, i.e. calling function only under certain conditions, or executing function in a certain order
    + _allows_ 
        + programming style where programs are written by putting together highly composable parts, combining in flexible ways the possible actions that work on a particular type of data
    + _state monad_ 
        + allows attachment of state information of any type to a calculation
        + Given any value type `t`, the corresponding type in the state monad is a function which accepts a state `s`, then outputs a new state `s` along with a return value of type `t`
        ```haskell
        type State s t = s -> (t, s)
        ```
    + _maybe monad_ 
        + option type `Maybe t` represents a value that is either a single value of type `t` or no value at all. We have 2 type constructors 
            ```haskell
            data Maybe t = Just t | Nothing
            ```
        + Can use this type as a simple sort of checked exception: at any point in a computation, the computation may fail, which causes the rest of the computation to be skipped and the final result to be `Nothing`, if all computation succeeds, then result is `Just x`
