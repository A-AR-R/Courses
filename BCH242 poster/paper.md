+ Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  

> __Homomeric 103QHtt/103QHtt pairs__ rapidly re-entered into inclusions, __heteromeric 103QHtt/Tau pairs__ remained excluded from the ‘ring-like’ inclusions.

_thesis_  
Expression of mHtt leads to Tau hyperphosphorylation, relocalization and sequestration through direct protein–protein interactions in inclusion-like compartments in the vicinity of the MTOC.



RESULTS
=======

####Tau hyperphosphorylation in HD mouse (R6/2 and KI140)

 Upon membranes probing with a __total Tau antibody__ (C-ter), we observed a significant shift of murine Tau isovariants from the __basic__ to the __acidic__ pH range in the cortex of R6/2 mice and KI140 when compared with _littermate controls_, consistent with increased phosphorylation.

![Figure 1](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/76/F1.large.jpg)  

 This observation was in line with the shift of Tau isovariant following probing of 2D membranes with __antibodies__ raised against __pSer404__ and __pSer396__

_SDS–PAGE and immunoblot analyses_        
we found a significant increase in Tau phosphorylation at __Ser396__ and __Ser404__ in the cortex of R6/2 mice (Fig. 2A), while Tau-1 immunoreactivity representing __unphosphorylated Tau__ was significantly decreased. In addition, we observed a significant shift of __total Tau__ immunoreactive bands toward a higher apparent molecular weight (Fig. 2A).

_DIRECT mHtt and Tau interaction_  
Determine whether mHtt and Tau could interact, co-localize and eventually co-aggregate in vivo.

Using confocal microscopy, we analyzed the expression of the two proteins in the brain of KI140 and littermate controls following immunofluorescence detection of __Tau pSer396__ and __Htt__ (__2B4__ or __Em48__ antibodies). Results showed no major colocalization of pSer396 Tau and mHtt in the brain of KI140 HD mice. __mHtt-containing intranuclear inclusions__ seen as typical round small dots in the nucleus (2B4, upper images; EM48, lower images). While Tau protein is localized to cytosol mostly. [DAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI) stains for A-T rich DNA; therefore stains for nucleous and chromosome.

_mHtt on expression/activation of Tau protein kinases_  
Neither expression nor activation of these kinases was found increased in R6/2 mice. Rather, we observed an increased Ser9 phosphorylation of [__GSK3β__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSK3B), reduced phosphorylation of [__CaMKII__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca2%2B/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase_II) and reduced [__cdk5__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase_5) expression in the cortex of R6/2 mice compared with littermate controls (Fig. 4A). Changes in __CaMKII__ and __cdk5__ were also observed in the cortex of KI140 animals (Fig. 4B). Therefore, these kinase changes thus fail to explain the increased Tau phosphorylation

_mHtt on expression/activation of Tau protein phosphatases_  
 In R6/2 mice, we found an association of __Tau hyperphosphorylation__ with a __significant decrease__ in [__PP1__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_phosphatase_1), [__PP2A__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_phosphatase_2) and [__PP2B__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin) expression (Fig. 4A). A trend for PP1 loss and a significant reduction in PP2B expression were also observed in KI140 animals (Fig. 4B).

> These results thus suggest that __phosphatase dysregulation__ correlates with Tau phosphorylation changes in HD animals.

####In vitro interaction between huntingtin and Tau   
Estimate the impact of mHtt on Tau phosphorylation and behavior and to evaluate a potential relationship between both proteins.

As in the in vivo situation, mHtt expression promoted Tau hyperphosphorylation at S396 (Fig. 5B).

_Filter trap assay_    
__BASELINE__   
Wild type __25QHtt__ did not produce SDS-insoluble aggregates in the presence or absence of Tau, while mutant __103QHtt__ produced more SDS-insoluble aggregates __in the absence of Tau__.   
__EXPERIMENTAL__      
It can be noticed that co-transfection of mutant Htt with Tau __reduced__ the levels of __insoluble aggregates__ (first line). Tau was retained in filter traps only when __co-transfected with mHtt__, but not wild-type Htt (second and third lines), indicating that they __co-aggregate__. Interestingly, retained Tau was phosphorylated at S396.   

__Htt__ and __GAPDH__ signals were used as __expression and loading controls__, respectively.

_Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay_    
To further evaluate the possible interaction between Htt and Tau at a cellular level.

_Results_  
> In summary, our in vitro results indicate that mHtt can interact with Tau and that this interaction interferes with [1] the normal pattern of mHtt aggregation, favors [2] Tau hyperphosphorylation and [3] alters the subcellular distribution of Tau, promoting its aggregation.

BiFC constructs for wild type (25Q) and mutant (103Q) Htt, as well as for Tau.  

> Combinations of 25QHtt with Tau maintained a microtubular localization, while 103QHtt disrupted Tau distribution, producing knot-like structures.

_Figure 6D_  
Wild-type Htt BiFC pairs showed mostly a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence, indicative of the formation of dimers/oligomers   
_Figure 6F_  
103QHtt BiFC pairs showed the occurrence of inclusion bodies    

_Figure 6C and H_  
Tau/Tau BiFC pairs marked the microtubular network, as expected given the microtubule-binding properties of Tau  
_[!] Figure 6E_  
When 25QHtt was combined with Tau, the cellular phenotype resembled that of Tau BiFC pairs, indicating that Tau __recruited__ 25QHtt to the microtubular network   
_[!] Figure 6G_  
Combinations of 103QHtt with Tau produced a __mixed phenotype__. As with 25QHtt, 103QHtt was also recruited to the microtubular network, with all cells showing the microtubular cytoskeleton but, in addition, we also observed cells with large inclusions  
_Figure 6I_  
Notably, 103QHtt/Tau transfected cells often exhibited bright ‘knot-like’ inclusions in their microtubular cytoskeletons, close to where the microtubular organizing center (MTOC) is located

#### Conclusions

mHtt >>> Tau hyperphosphorylation >>> altered Tau localization / microtubule-stabilizing function >>> HD symptoms

1. Brain of symptomatic HD animals and cultured cells co-expressing mHtt and Tau constructs showed significant __Tau hyperphosphorylation__, indicating that the expression of the former is sufficient to promote hyperphosphorylation of the latter.
  + Notably, in HD mice, we did not notice increase in the activity of the main Tau kinases.
  + we observed significant reduction in phosphatase expression.
    + may explain increased Tau phosphorylation in transgenic HD mice and in cells expressing 103QHtt.

2. Expression of mHtt is associated with changes in Tau function. Because Tau hyperphosphorylation is thought to impair its __cellular localization__ and __microtubule-stabilizing__ function. This may be contributing to axonal transport defects, cognitive deficits, motor alterations, and synaptic plasticity defects in the hippocampus.

> Whether Tau alterations precede, contribute or are concomitant to behavioral impairments and pathological features that characterize HD remains to be evaluated.  

3. While mHtt has a clear effect on Tau phosphorylation and cellular distribution, in vitro, _Tau also induces changes in mHtt behavior._   
  + mHtt usually forms solid inclusions throughout cytosol
  + in the presence of Tau,
    + typical mHtt aggregates almost disappear, and Htt is at least partially recruited to the microtubular network.
    + In a significant number of cells, one or two large ring-like inclusions are formed in the perinuclear region, where cellular quality control inclusion bodies are located, consistent with previous observations indicating that mHtt accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions containing sequestrated vesicle-associated proteins, such as HSP70, dynamin or HIP1. ([ref](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/1/269.abstract?ijkey=c8f7e40d4a56874855da15fdaa9967e914207406&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha))   

4. mHtt-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation is consistently found in vitro and in vivo using biochemical and histochemical methods, mHtt/Tau colocalization and co-aggregation is readily detected only in vitro using overexpression systems, but not tissue from the animal models tested.
  + In vitro, under optimized conditions, co-localization was detected in ∼16% of cells.
  + suggest that a direct mHtt/Tau interaction might be a rare phenomenon in vivo, and that the major impact of mHtt toward Tau is related to kinase/phosphatase imbalance.


> Tau may play an important and understudied role in HD pathogenesis.
