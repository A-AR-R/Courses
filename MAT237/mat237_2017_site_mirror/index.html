<p> Here is the information about the final exam: </p>

<p>
<li> The exam is cumulative from the beginning of the year to the end. (See the course syllabus for coverage of topics)
<li> 20% of the exam questions are very similar to questions from the *mini-list*.
<li> We have not chosen exact questions from the big list on purpose, but we strongly recommend them as a great source of practice problems.
<li> There are 14 questions on the exam: 6 questions worth 10 points each & 8 questions worth 5 points each.
<li> 25% of the questions use the word "prove" in their statements.

</p>

<p> Good luck with your preparations! </p></p>

                        <p><p> Dear Students,

<p> 
You have  been sent an email from crowdmark with links to see your MAT237Y test 4  (you can see the test's statistics through Crowdmark). The test is out of 60, and the maximum possible score is 65/60, because Q3 was a bonus question worth 5 marks.
</p>

<p>
Crowdmark thinks the test is out of 65, but don't worry, we will keep track of this fact in the final calculation of the grades.
 </p>

<p>
I uploaded a solution of the test to the course website:
<a href=http://utmat237.com/media/document/test4solutions.pdf>Test 4 Solutions </a>

</p>

<p>
If you think there is a marking error, please <b> read the solutions carefully</b>. If after careful review of the solutions, you are still convinced there is a marking error,  please <b> send an e-mail to </b> the following e-mail address: <b> crowdb@math.utoronto.ca</b> , by <b>Saturday, March 4th at 11:59 pm </b> (after this deadline, no remarking requests will be considered) with the following information:

<p> Please send all e-mails about remarking to <b> crowdb@math.utoronto.ca</b> . (Please don't send them to other e-mail addresses, that is to your professor's or the coordinator's) </p>

</p>

<li> Name
<li> Student Number
<li> Exam Number (next to # on top of each page of the test)
<li> Question
<li><b> Detailed explanation </b> of what you wrote, how it compares with the solution, and what you believe to be the marking error.
(Please note: requests that are not substantiated with specific reference to where the error in marking may have taken place, will not be considered)

</p>
 
<p>
<b> Important </b>. Please be aware that when you request to have your test re-marked, <b> your grade may be lowered </b>. This does happen.

<p> <b> Having difficulty locating the crowdmark e-mail in your utoronto.ca inbox? Please follow these steps. </b> </p>

<li> 1. Look in your @utoronto.ca account using the utoronto webmail 

<a href=http://webmail.utoronto.ca >Webmail </a> for e-mails dated Monday February 27th, 2017.
<li> 2. Use the utoronto.ca webmail to perform a search selecting to search "ALL FOLDERS" for the search term "Crowdmark" in the "Entire Message" Field.
<li> 3. If you need further assistance using your @utoronto.ca webmail account, please visit the Information Services at Robarts Library.
<li> 4. If after having completed step 1 to step 3 above,  you still can't find the crowdmark e-mail. Please send an e-mail to crowdb@math.utoronto.ca.

<p>We have uploaded Test 3 from last year's course, in the "Notes and Uploads" section of the website.</p>

<p>(Update: please note that there is a missing absolute value sign in Q7 of last year's test. In the third bullet, there should be an absolute value around the partial derivative. Its absolute value should be less than or equal to 1.) </p>

</p>It is recommended that you use it as extra practice in preparation for this year's Test 3. <p>

<p>Please note:</p>

<li> Past tests' topics don't necessarily correspond in an exact manner to this year's test topics. </li>
<li> For example, Q5 from last year's Test 3 (on the mean value theorem) is not a topic that is on this year's Test 3. </p></p>

<p>
The terms "big" and "small" refer to the magnitude of a number. For example saying that "a is sufficiently small" means that the "magnitude of a is small". That is, "a is close to 0".
</p>

<p>
For example, this applies to Q4 on Big List #11.

<p>This will apply to Test 3 as well, and I have edited the test announcement below to reflect the change.

<p>I recommend that you still read the supplementary notes, as they elaborate on the topics, and will lead you to have a deeper understanding of the material, and hopefully to do better on the tests as a result.</p>

<p>
For Test 3, we do not guarantee to ask an exact problem from the Mini-List (or slight modification thereof), as we have been doing with the Big-List.
</p>

<p>For future tests, however, we may choose to do this. </p>

<p>
In other words, for future tests (i.e. Tests 4 & 5), "the rule of 25%" of the questions being slight modifications of the Big List will apply to the Big and Mini Lists together.
</p>

<p>
I still recommend you work on the Mini-List in your preparations for Test 3, as extra practice.

Last, but not least, please take a look at the "Potter Problem Set 9.75". It can be found under the "Notes" section of the course. It deals with the topics of "parametrizations and uniform continuity". It should be considered as an extra big list problem set.

<p>
Just like Tyler's Notes, these supplementary notes form part of the course, and therefore are required reading. </p>

<p> These are short, high-quality, expositions of some beautiful mathematics! I hope you enjoy reading them! </p></p>

<p>
Students have spoken about wanting more practice problems. We are introducing a "Mini List of Problems". </p>

<p> They can be found under the "Notes" section of the course. </p>

<p> For each "Big List", there will be a corresponding "Mini List". I envision that these problems will be very useful, particularly (but not exclusively) for practice for the final exam.</p>

<p> I expect these problems to contribute to an enriching learning experience! </p></p>

<p> 
You should have received an email from crowdmark with links to see your test (you can see the test's statistics through Crowdmark).
 </p>

<p>
I uploaded a solution of the first test to the course website:
<a href=http://utmat237.com/media/document/test1_solutions.pdf>Test 1 Solutions </a>


</p>
 
<p>
If you find marking errors, please <b> read the solutions </b>. If you still think that there is a marking error, <b> send an e-mail to </b> the following e-mail address: <b> crowdb@math.utoronto.ca</b> , by <b>Friday October 21st at 11:59 pm </b> (after this deadline, no remarking requests will be considered) with the following information:

</p>

<li> Name
<li> Student Number
<li> Exam Number (next to # on top of each page of the test)
<li> Question
<li><b> Detailed explanation </b> of what you wrote, how it compares with the solution, and what is the marking error

</p>
 
<p>
<b> Important </b>. Be aware that when you request to have your test re-marked, <b> your grade may be lowered </b>. This does happen, as the graders were instructed to be generous on the first read.</p>
