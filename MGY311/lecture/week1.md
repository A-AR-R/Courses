1. average distance between occurrences of 4 nucleotides in the genome?  

2. If genome contains 28%

1. list proteins that interact with DNA
  + specific
    + transcription factor  
    + RNA polymerase   
      + specific initially but able to transcribe non-sequence specifically  
    + restriction enzyme  
  + non-specific
    + DNA ligase
    + single stranded DNA binding protein
      + stabilizes DNA during replication
    + DNA repair  
    + topoismerase
    + DNA replication
    + methylases
    + recombination enzyme


2. how many bp required to specify a unique DNA binding site? this is important to PCR, and to proteins that binds DNA specifically, knockouts, CRISPR
  + viral genome (6X10^4)
    + 8bp
  + bacterial genome (3 X 10^8)
    + 11bp
  + mammalian genome (3 X 10^9)
    + 16bp

  > ind the smallest n such that (1/4)^n < 1/(size of genome) 4^n > size of genome


3. structures of DNA
  + major and minor groove affect binding
  + DNA base is planar  
  + stacking interaction keeps DNA stable  
    + van der waal interaction (temporary dipole) created by  
      + a strong electronegative oxygen on a base that is on top of the previous base
      + 2 hydrophobic aromatic ring stacking on top of each other creating temporary dipole
    + hydrophobic effect created by burial of base to internal of DNA
  + DNA bases between strands distance themselves optimally
    + length of H bonds vary between bases

Hydrogen bond form resonance structure between complementary base pairs
  + reinforcing the stability of the double helix

double stranded genome
+ advantage
  + replication and repair using one template
  + hydrogen bond makes them less influenced by outside chemical damage
+ disadvantage  
  + would be structurally easier to replicate as no need for helicase ...  


How do protein recognize DNA in sequence specific fashion

+ identify the major and the minor groove in 2D fashion
  + spot position of ribose sugar groups. The distance between ribose groups
    + if smaller then that side is minor groove
    + otherwise its a major groove  
+ proteins recognizes hydrogen bonding pattern on mostly the major groove
  + if the pattern is different, then protein could recognize the nucleotide  
  + hydrogen bonding pattern is different for each base pair and its orientation
  + rest structure around the groove also affect protein-DNA interaction
