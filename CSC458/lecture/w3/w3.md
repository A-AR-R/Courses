# Chapter 3

+ _motivation_ 
    + ethernet connect to no more than 1024 hosts, P2P connects only 2
    + need ways to interconnect different types of lins and networks
    + _switch_  
        + device that interconnect links 
        + _bridges_ 
            + subclass of switch that connects Ethernet segments
        + take packet in and _forward_ them to the right output
    + _gateway (router)_
        + device that interconnect disparate networks and links
        + IP..
    + _Routing_ 
        + find an efficient, loop free, dynamic path through a network 

#### 3.1 Switching and Bridging


+ _switching_ 
    + mechanism to interconnect links to form a large network 
+ _switch_
    + _definition_
        + multi-input, multi-output device that _transfer packets_ from one input to 1/more outputs
        + _switching/forwarding_ packet from input to output
    + _star shaped topology_
        + ![](2017-10-08-20-29-49.png)
        + Can interconnect switches with P2P links, so can build network of alrge geographical scope
        + _more scalable than shared-media network_
    + _how to forward_ 
        + _datagram (connectionless)_ 
        + _virtual circuit (connection-oriented)_
    + _assumption_ 
        + global uniqueness of _addresses_
        + we can identify ports with number/nearest host
+ _Datagram_ 
    + _idea_ 
        + ![](2017-10-08-20-51-30.png)
        + ![](2017-10-08-20-51-43.png)
        + each packet contains complete destination address
        + switch consult _forwarding table_ for the lik to forward packets to
    + _characteristics_ 
        + _connectinoless_ 
            + a host can send a packet anywhere anytime 
        + host has no way of knowing if network is capable of delivering it or if destination host is up and running 
        + each packet forwarded independently of previous packets 
            + may forward via different route
        + switch or link failure might not have any serious affect on communication 
            + if its possible to find an alternate route around the failure
            + _robust_
+ _Virtual circuit switching_ 
    + ![](2017-10-08-20-56-09.png)
    + _idea_ 
        + requires setting up virtual connection from source to destination before data is sent
    + _two phases_ 
        + _connection phase_ 
            + set up entries in a _VC table_ in each swtiching through which the connectino passes
            + _contains_ 
                + _virtual circuit identifier (VCI)_ 
                + incoming interface 
                + outgoing switch 
                + potentially VCI used for outgoing packets 
            + packet arrrives, 
                + search by incoing interface with matching VCI value in header 
                + forward with specifiied outgoing interface
    + ...

+ _Bridges and Lan switches_ 
    + _hub_
        + accept LAN frames as inputs and foward them out on all other outputs
    + _bridges_ 
        + a class of switches that forward packets between LANs (local area networks) such as ethernet
        + similar in functionality to switches, also extends total bandwidth of a network
        + forms a _extended LAN_
    + _vs. repeater_ 
        + repeater may exceed physical limitation of ethernet 
    + _learning bridges_
        + ![](2017-10-08-21-04-12.png) 
        + _observation_ 
            + bridge does not need to forward all frames (i.e. ignore frames sent from the same LAN)
        + _idea_ 
            + let each bridge inspect _source_ address in all frames it receives, 
        + _example_ 
            + when A sends frame to host on either side of bridge
            + bridge receives this frame records the fact that a frame from host A was just received on port 1
        + _steps_ 
            + table is initially empty
            + timeout associated with each entry added
        + _flooding_  
    + _spanning tree algorithm_ 
        + _motivation_ 
            + learning bridge is problematic if loops exists in the network
            + we would have flooding cycling around in a loop (both directions) without ever stopping
        + ![](2017-10-08-21-10-04.png)
            + _steps_
                + packet enter B4 via J
                + _destination address in any bridge's forwarding table_
                + B4 sends a copy to ethernet H and I
                + B6 forwards packets to ethernet G
                + B1 then forward back to ethernet Hs
                + B4 still doesnt have destination in its table, so forward packet back to ethernet I and J
                + cycle goes on
        + _distributed MST algorithm_
