+ _bit encoding_
    + ![](2017-09-21-13-37-51.png)
    + different voltage corresponds to 0/1
    + duration of signals representing bit is important
    + _clock signal_ 
        + tracks duration of signals
            + posedge of clock signal represent sampling points (middle of the bit)
        + _how to send_ 
            + send signal along another frequency, 
                + but _wastes resource_
            + send alongside with bit encoding
                + but _using higher bandwidth_ (doubles the alteration)



+ _frame_ 
    + `flag-data-flag`
    + `flag` 
        + some unique bit pattern 
    + if `flag` appears in `data` 
        + escape the bits (`flag` and escape bits) with a special escape bit pattern

+ _model_ 
    + _latency_ 
        + progapation delay + time to put data given a certain bandwidth

+ _error detection/correction_ 
    + _goal_ 
        + reduce sending wrong bits over network 
    + _naive solution_ 
        + sending `101` as `110011` if dont have consecutive `00` and `11`s then there is an error
            + but doubles amount of data sent
    + _even parity (1D)_
        + sending `010111110-_` 
            + where the last 1-bit makes the entire frame has even number of `1`s
            + in this case its 0
        + say if received `010111100`
            + compare last bit `0` with computed parity bit `1`
            + if different, then error happens
        + _problem_ 
            + even number of errors, cannot detect 
    + _2D parity_
        ```

              | Parity
        01011 | 1 
        11100 | 1

        10011   B parity
          |--> mistake
        ```
        + if 1 error, able to detect exact bits that is changed, 
            + just flipped the bit to correct it
        + if  >1 error, unable to detect exact bit
            + but know its wrong,
            + so ask for resending data
