#### 2.1 Perspectives in Connecting 

+ _link_ 
    + ![](2017-09-26-14-08-29.png)
    + _note_ 
        + various type of devices used by end-users
    + _goal_
        + provides common abstraction of something as complex and diverse as a link
        + idea is devices does not care what sort of link it is connected to, only thing that matters is that it has a link to the Internet
+ _classes of links_ 
    + _characteristic_  
        + a physical medium carrying signals in the form of electromagnetic waves
        + binary data is encoded in the signal
    + _waves_ 
        + ![](2017-09-26-14-25-52.png)
        + _frequency_ (Hz) with which electromagnetic waves oscillate
        + _wavelength_ distance between adjacent maxima
        + `speedOfLight = frequency x wavelength`
        + _modulation_ 
            + varying frequency, amplitude, or phase of the signal to effect the transmission of information
    + _assumption_ 
        + have high/low signals over the network and we are concerned with encoding data 
    + ![](2017-09-26-14-30-38.png)


#### 2.2 Encoding (NRZ, NRZI, Manchest, 4B/5B)

+ _goal_ 
    + encode binary data that source node want to send into signals that the links are able to carry and then to decode the signal back to the corresponding binary data at the receiving node
    + assume working with high/low voltage
+ _network adaptor_ 
    + connects a node to a link
    + responsible for encoding,  
+ _Non-return to zero (NRZ)_ 
    + ![](2017-09-26-14-33-40.png)
    + _idea_
        + map 1 to high signal and 0 to low signal
        + a sequence of consecutive 1s/0s means signal stay high/low on link for extended period of time
    + _problem_ 
        + _baseline wander_ 
            + receiver usually keeps an average of signal seen and use this average to distinguish between high/low
            + too many consecutive 1s/0s cause this average to change, making it more difficult to detect a significant change in the signal
        + _clock recovering problem_ 
            + both encoding/decoding are driven by a clock 
            + sender/receiver clock have to be synchronized in order to recover same bits transmitted
            + _sending clock signal with another wire_? 
                + too costly 
            + _clock recovery_ 
                + receiver derive clock from received sdignal
                + whenever signal changes, 1->0 or 0->1, the receiver knows it is at a clock cycle boundary
            + long period of time without such a transition leads to _clock drift_
+ _Non-return to zero inverted (NRZI)_
    + ![](2017-09-26-14-42-19.png)
    + _idea_ 
        + sender make a transition from the current signal to encode a 1
        + stay at current signal to encode a 0
    + _discussion_ 
        + solves problem of consecutive 1s
        + but does nothing for consecutive 0s, still a problem
+ _Manchester encoding_ 
    + _idea_ 
        + merge clock with signal 
        + transmit XOR of NRZ-encoded data and the block
        + a high-low pair is one clock cycle 
    + _encoding_
        + 0: low-to-high transition
        + 1: high-to-low transition
        + since both 0/1 results in transition in signal, clocks can be recovered
    + _problem_ 
        + doubles the rate at which signal transitions are made on the link
        + implies 50% efficient only 
+ _4B/5B_
    + _idea_ 
        + insert extra bits of 0 or 1 in the bit stream to break up long sequences of 0s or 1s
        + every 4bit encoded in 5bit code with look up table
            + ![](2017-09-27-23-22-14.png)
        + 5-bit codes 
            + <=1 leading 0
            + <=2 trailing 0
        + _implication_ 
            + no pair of 5-bit code results in >3 consecutive 0s
            + worst case: `011100,011100`
        + _how about the 1s?_
            + solved by NRZI already, 
    + _problem_ 
        + reduction in efficiency to 80%, better than Manchester

            + _problem_
                + `ETX` might appear in the data portion of frame
            + _solution: character stuffing_ 
                + escape `ETX` by preceding with a `DLE` (data-link-escape) whenever `ETX` appear in the body of frame

            + _problem_

#### 2.4 Error Detection

+ _motivation_

        + usually able to send only `k` redundant bits for `n`-bit message
        + goal is to maximize probability of detecting errors using only a small number of redundant bits
    + _naive impl_ 
        + _idea_
            + transmit 2 complete copies of data 
            + if they differ at receiver, then error occurs
        + _problem_ 
            + sends `n` redundant-bits for `n`-bit message
            + errors can go undetected, i.e. same position on first/second copy
    + _general procedure_ 
        + sender applies algo to message to generate redundant bits, called _error-detecting codes_
        + transmit both message and redundant bits
        + receiver applies same algorithm to received message
        + compare result with one sent by sender
        + if match, then no error, otherwise errors were introduced
    + _checksum_ 
        + a specific type of error-detecting codes when the algorithm that generate them is based on addition
+ _Two-dimensional Parity_ 
    + _one dimensional parity_ 
        + involves adding extra bit toa 8-bit code to balance the number of 1s in the byte
        + _odd/even parity_ 
            + sets 8th bit to 1 if needed to give an odd/even number of 1s in the byte
    + _Two-dimensional parity_ 
        + ![](2017-09-28-12-31-28.png)
        + _idea_ 
            + adding extra bit to a 7-bit code to balance number of 1s in the byte
            + then does one-dimensional parity on bit positions over all bytes in the frame, resulting in an extra _parity byte_ for the entire frame
        + _capability_

            + `1010 + 1100 = 0110` with carry of 1
            + carry of 1 from most significant bit causes us to increment result by ones complement arithmetic
            + so `0110 += 1 -> 0111` which is `-8`
        ```c
