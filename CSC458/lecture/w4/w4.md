```

(change 4->60)
     |
x -- 4 --- y ---- 1 ----z
|________ 50 ___________|


Routing tables 

    x   y   z
x   0   4   5
    x   y   y

    x   y   z
y   4   0   1
    x   y   z

    x   y   z
z   5   1   0       - (5) is slow to update, a solution is to set it to \infty
    y   y   z               - this way when deciding next y->x 
                            - we compare 60 vs. \infty, then we have 60 has link cost

--- t1: change 4->60

    x   y   z
x   0   51  50
    x   z   z
    (x->y is re-routed to x->z->y)


    x   y   z
y   6   0   
    z   y   z   
    (when y recalculate link cost, 
    it will use old values from z, 5+1=6)

    x   y   z
z   5   1   0
    y   y   z
    (same table copied)

--- t2

    x   y   z
z   7   1   0
    y   y   z
    (table updated by changes broadcasted by `y` from t1)

+ bellman ford
    + distance vector (DV)
        + need distances from neighbors
    + limited info 

+ dijkstra algo 
    + link state (LS)
        + need state of every link in the network
        + imply that each node will broadcast link cost to neighbor to all other nodes
        + each node calculate distance to every other node
        + the routing table would forward packet to the node in the resulting MST of dijkstra algo
    + idea
        + take the closest node to the group of considered nodes, Q
        + update all link distances, reachable in 1 hop from Q 



+ link state packet
    + sequence number: used for proofing getting packet twice
