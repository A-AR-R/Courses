_Markov model_
+ A stochastic model used to model randomly changing systems where it is assumed that future states depend only on the current state and not on the events that occurred before it.  
+ Used for weather prediction, speech recognition, generate music... mostly sequential data


_Markov chain_

+ Models the state of a system with a random variable that changes through time. In this context, the Markov property suggests that the distribution for this variable depends only on the distribution of the previous state.


_Hidden Markov Model__

+ A Markov chain for which the state is only partially observable. In other words, observations are related to the state of the system, but they are typically insufficient to precisely determine the state.
