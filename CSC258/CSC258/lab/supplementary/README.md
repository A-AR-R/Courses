__Verilog__
+ hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems.
  + describes the structure and behaviour of electronic circuits, and most commonly, *digital logic circuits*.
  + simply, it specifies circuit diagrams
+ most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction.

---

Primitive gates:
+ `and(out, in, in, ...)` specifies AND gate.   
+ `or(out, in, in..)`, `not(out, in)`, `nand(out, in, in, ..)`, `nor(out, in, in, ..)`, `buf(out, in)`, `xor(out, in, in, ..)`, `xnor(out, in, in, ..)`

---

Modules:
+ a combination of logical gates with a set of inputs and output signals


Make an XOR gate.

express using logical gates

![](assets/README-b0963.png)

`wire`: declares wires that are used _internally_ in the circuit to connect components together. Usually want to label the output of each gates so that we can refer to it later as input to another gate.


![](assets/README-8f5de.png)


Circuit description
+ Declare the `module` indicating start/end of module as well as input/output signals
+ Describe which of module's external signals are input/output
+ provide labels for internal `wire` needed in the circuit
+ Specify components of circuit and how they are connected; Order does not matter hre.


```v
module xor_gate(A, B, Y);
  input A, B;
  output Y;

  wire not_a, not_b;
  wire a_not_b, b_not_a;

  and(b_not_a, B, not_a);
  and(a_not_b, A, not_b);
  or(Y, b_not_a, a_not_b);

  not(not_a, A);
  not(not_b, B)
endmodule
```


`assign` is an alternate way to express internal logic of a module
+ `assign Y = A & B;` equivalent to `and(Y, A, B)`
+ `assign Y = A | B;` equivalent to `or(Y, A, B)`
+ `assign Y = ~A;` equivalent to `not(Y, A)`

Operators
+ _Bitwise_ operation takes multi-input bits and perform operation on corresponding bits of each value

| operator | operation   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| ~     |  bitwise NOT |
| & | bitwise AND |
|&#124; | bitwise OR |
| ^ | bitwise XOR |  
| ! | NOT |
| && | AND |
| &#124;&#124;| OR |
| == | test equality |



```v
module xor_gate(A, B, Y);
  input A, B;
  output Y;

  assign Y = A & ~B | B & ~A;
endmodule
```



---

A module can be used in other components once created

*Half_adder*
+ The half adder adds two single binary digits A and B. It has two outputs, sum (S) and carry (C). The carry signal represents an overflow into the next digit of a multi-digit addition.
+ The value of the sum is `2C + S`

```v
module half_adder(X, Y, C, S);
  input X, Y;
  output C, S;

  and(C, X, Y);
  xor_gate(S, X, Y);
endmodule
```

*mux*
+ In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line.
+ used to economizing connection over a single channel
+ Requires `log n` switches for n inputs
+ specifically a 2-to-1 mux has boolean equation

![](assets/README-d6c5b.png)
![](assets/README-a58fd.png)
![](assets/README-37688.png)
![](assets/README-77708.png)

```v
module mux(X, Y, S, M);
  input X, Y, S;
  output M;

  assign M = X & ~S | Y & S;
endmodule
```


A 3-to-1 mux

```v
module mux(X, Y, Z, S0, S1, M);
  input X, Y, Z, S0, S1;
  output M;

  assign M = S0 & ~S1 & X | ~S0 & S1 & Y | S0 & S1 & Z;
endmodule
```

Now a 3-bit mux

 __busses__
+ indicate several different wires with ranges
  + useful for working with multi-bit values, or an array of wires
  + i.e. a byte is 8 bits wide
+ `input [2:0] X` and `input [0:2] X` are equivalent, differing only in that the former specify the first bit as `X[2]` and the latter with `X[0]`.
  + by convention go from high to low
+ `{a[2], a[1]}` is equivalent to `a[2:1]`
  + takes the two wire and forms an un-named bus from them

```v
module mux(X, Y, S, M);
  input [2: 0] X, Y;   // 3 bit input
  input S;             // 1 bit input
  output [2: 0] M;     // 3 bit output

  assign M[0] = X[0] & ~S | Y[0] & S;
  assign M[1] = X[1] & ~S | Y[1] & S;
  assign M[2] = X[2] & ~S | Y[2] & S;
endmodule
```

The above could be expressed as follows since the operators are bitwise

```v
assign M = X & ~S | Y & S;
```

FPGA
+ A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence "field-programmable".

```v
module top(SW, LEDR);
  input [9:0] SW;
  output [9:0] LEDR;

  add_three(
      .a(SW[0]),
      .b(SW[1]),
      .c(SW[2]);
    );
endmodule
```

Always block
+ another way of describing a circuit
+ syntax
  + `always @ (<sensitivity list>) begin <body> end`
+ outputs must be of `reg` type
+ must have a new value at the end of always block

```v
// mux
reg m;  // used as outputs to always block
always @ (*) begin;
  m = s ? y : x;
end

// another method
reg m ;
always @ (*) begin;
  if(s)
    m = y;
  else
    m = x;
end
