  Not handling infinity (max_int) and generating loops was -5 marks. Not
  dealing with non-Time objects (dashes -) was also -5 marks. Marks were
  deducted also for computing wrong weights (e.g. ignoring waiting times or
  computing them in a wrong way).

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

<p>
Assignments will consist of
a number of "pen-and-paper" questions
(the "written" portion,
whose solution involves no computer programming and
can be handwritten or typed)
and a number of "programming" questions
(whose solution is entirely computer programming).
</p>
<p>
The <b>written portion</b> must be handed in using the
<a href="../admin/cover.pdf">cover sheet for assignments (Adobe PDF document)</a>
<a href="../admin/cover.ps">(PS)</a>.
If you are working in a group (of at most two students),
only submit one copy of your solutions and write both
students' names on the cover sheet.
All written portions must be submitted
directly to the instructor by the beginning of class
on the specified due date, or submitted to the course drop box
in BA 2220 at least 30 minutes prior to class.
Late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted
(including assignments submitted after the first 5 minutes of class)
except in truly unusual circumstances.
(See the
<!--
<a href="../admin/index.shtml#dates">important dates</a>
for the exact due date of each assignment, and the
-->
<a href="../admin/special.html">policy on special consideration</a>
for how to request an individual extension for unusual circumstances).
</p>
<p>
The <b>programming portion</b> must be handed in electronically.
<!--using the UTSC submit command.-->
Hardcopies (such as computer printouts) will not be accepted,
as your code will be executed to determine your mark. 
If you are working in a group (of at most two students),
only submit one copy of your programming solutions
and include both students' names in the file headers.
Though your programming portion is due at the same time as the
written portion, we will not collect the electronic submissions
until Thursday at 5:30pm (so you may think of this as an automatic extension).
It is your responsibility to ensure your programming solution is
submitted on time, as we cannot automatically disable acceptance
through submit at a predetermined time.
Ensure your programs work correctly on the CDF computer system;
if they do not, you will not receive any credit.
</p>
<h3>
Frequently solved problems:
</h3>
<ul>
  <li><i>I need a computer account. How do I get one?</i><br>
  You should already have your account info. Read details at the
  <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/welcome/">CDF Wecome</a> website.

  <li><i>What computing resources do I have access to?</i><br>
  Read the <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/welcome/cdf.html">Student's Guide to CDF</a>.

  <li><i>How do I submit my files?</i><br>
  Make sure you're in the directory that contains the file(s) you want
  to submit, and use the command:<br>
  <tt>submit -c csc263h -a </tt><i>&lt;assignment&gt;</i><tt> </tt><i>&lt;files&gt;</i><br>
  replacing <i>&lt;assignment&gt;</i> with the assignment name (PGM1, PGM2, ...)
  and replacing <i>&lt;files&gt;</i> with the list of files you are submitting.
  <br>
  There is also a web interface described in the "Submitting Work" section
  of the <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/workathome/">Working at Home</a>
  tutorial.

  <li><i>What else do I need to know about the submit tool?</i><br>
  Typing <tt>man submit</tt> will give you the manual page. Some highlights:

  <ul>
    <li>Submit files foo.c and bar.h for assignment named PGM1 in course
    csc263h:<br>
    <tt>submit -c csc263h -a PGM1 foo.c bar.h</tt>

    <li>Resubmit file foo.c to the same place:<br>
    <tt>submit -c csc263h -f -a PGM1 foo.c</tt>

    <li>List submitted files:<br>
    <tt>submit -l -c csc263h -a PGM1</tt>
  </ul>

<!--
  <li><i>I tried to submit and got the error:
    "submit: You're not in the cscb63s group." What do I do?</i><br>
  The computer system doesn't know you're in the class.
  Make sure that you're officially enrolled in the course.
  In general, if you enrolled in the class recently, you might have to wait
  a couple of days before the system administrators give you permission to
  submit files to our course.
  -->

  <li><i>I submitted an old version of my file, and now I want to resubmit
    my new version. How do I do it?</i><br>
  First of all, good idea! Submitting early and often makes sure the
  submit system is working for you, and if anything happens (you sleep in,
  your computer crashes, etc.), you already have a copy submitted for
  marking. We only keep the most recent copy that you submitted.
  To submit a new version, use the "-f" option for submit to overwrite
  the old version:<br>
  <tt>submit -c csc263h -f -a </tt><i>&lt;assignment&gt;</i> <i>&lt;files&gt;</i><br>
</ul>
