<p>
<b>Unofficial grades posted</b><br>
I have posted unofficial grades on the online marks posting:
they are not official until approved by the faculty and posted to ROSI.
You'll note that to compensate for the length of the exam, I've reduced
the number of marks it was taken out of.
</p>
<p>
Have a great rest of the summer!
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 14 August 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Good luck!</b><br>
Good luck to everyone on the final exam!
</p>

<h3>Monday, 13 August 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>w4 marks posted</b><br>
The marks for w4 have now been posted.
The TA is still out of the country with the assignments, however,
she has kindly scanned copies for you, which will be available in
today's office hour.
</p>
<p>
<b>p4 marks posted too</b><br>
The p4 marks are now posted too. Some sample output is also posted.
The TA marked each assignment by hand, but the sample
output will show you approximately what he was looking for.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remarks must be submitted prior to exam</b><br>
I will be away for two weeks following the exam, so please submit any
remark requests before the exam (otherwise your final grade may be delayed).
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 9 August 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>p3 tester posted</b><br>
The tester we used for marking p3 is now posted on the assignments page.
The TA generated some diffs for the marking, which I can send to you
on request.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 8 August 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>p4 now due at 11:59pm on Friday</b><br>
As requested in class, p4 is now due by midnight on Friday evening.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 7 August 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Sample Dijkstra.java code posted</b><br>
Now available from the assignments page is a sample solution code
for p3 Dijkstra.java (might be useful for your p4 code if your
Dijkstra didn't work correctly!).
</p>
<p>
<b>p3 marks posted</b><br>
p3 marks are now added to the marks posting.
</p>
<p>
<b>Extra pre-exam office hours</b><br>
I'll hold an extra office hour on Monday, August 13, 5pm-6pm.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning about unauthorized exam aids</b><br>
I received the following from the undergraduate chair to share with you:
</p>
<blockquote>
The Faculty of Arts and Science has become very strict about unauthorized
aids at final exams. This is a response to some innovative cheaters.
The consequences have been significant: students may lose not just the
aid but also the exam. This is the case whether or not they intended to
use the unauthorized aid to cheat.
<p>
There have been a lot of cases recently with cell phones, pagers and
unauthorized calculators. Cell phones and pagers are not allowed,
even if they will be used just to tell the time.
<p>
In a recent year, a case involved two friends who were communicating.
They may just have been rolling their eyes as if to say "this test is
stupid, ha ha", but there was obviously communication going on and they
were charged. Unfortunately it's completely untenable to have a rule which
says that communication is allowed if it's not on the topic of the exam;
so people who can't help communicating should take care not to sit near
each other.
<p>
Please warn your students about these strict rules.
</blockquote>
<p>
The upshot is, please don't do anything that could be (mis)construed
as cheating. Since the Faculty runs the final exam and not me,
I can't do much if you are discovered with an unauthorized aid.
Be careful, and good luck on the exam!

unavailable from 6pm Monday July 30th for approximately 3 hours
to apply security updates and perform general maintenance.
The course webpage will not be available then, but 
CDF's labs and servers will not be affected (and remain available),

</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 3 July 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Some lecture notes posted</b><br>
Due to popular request, I have typed up and posted <i>some</i>
of the lecture notes/summaries and put them up on the
<a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
They are probably not complete, but occasionally go in additional detail
from what I had time for in class. Use them to supplement your notes,
not replace them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Midterm solutions</b><br>
The midterm paper and some sample solutions are now posted to the
<a href="tests/#mt">Tests</a> page.

<p>
<b>Solutions for A2</b><br>
The solutions for the written portion have been posted to the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page, so you can use them to study.
Also, I just corrected a typo in the balance factors, so you might want
a new copy (or change 10's - to +) if you downloaded them earlier.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 25 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Hints posted to course BB</b><br>
Some hints have been posted to the course bulletin board...
the link is at the top of the course home page.
Don't forget about the TA office hours this evening
if you still need some help.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 21 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Midterm test details</b><br>
Additional details about the midterm test have now been posted
to the <a href="tests">Tests</a> page.
Please note that the test will be 60 minutes, written at the start of lecture,
followed by a 15 minute break and about one hour lecture (no tutorial, though
the lecture will run into the usual tutorial timeslot).
</p>
<p>
<b>TA office hours</b><br>
The TA will hold office hours 4-6pm in BA2272 on Monday, June 25
(enter through the BA2270 lab). Bring all your A2 questions.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 18 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 programming part posted</b><br>
It's in the usual place. Keep in mind its due date has been
extended one week too.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 14 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Office hours change for today</b><br>
Due to a last-minute seminar scheduling, I must cancel the first hour of
my office hours today. Office hours will now be 4-5pm, though I will be
available in my office before 3pm too. You can also pick up your
assignment 1 during the office hours.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 13 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 extension</b><br>
As decided in class, the due date for A2 has been extended by one week.
You won't get them marked and returned before the midterm, but I'll post
the sample solutions as soon as you hand it in.
</p>
<p>
<b>A1 marks posted</b><br>
The marks for both parts of A1 have now been posted in the
<a href="marks">online marks database</a>.
Please make sure they are recorded correctly, and, if you haven't 
done so already,
change your password so that anyone who happens to have access to your
student number can't get in and see your marks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Research seminar on hashing</b><br>
In a convenient coincidence, there is a research seminar on linear probing
in hash tables this Thursday at 11AM in BA1200.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Linear probing with constant independence
  (OR: Why a handful is better than a couple)<br>
  Rasmus Pagh<br>
  Computational Logic and Algorithms group,
  IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark<br>
  <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/reg/list_full.pl?20070514-1100.31428">details and abstract...</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a chance for you to see what researchers are doing in an area
of computer science you've just learned about. Don't worry whether you'll
understand everything (I probably won't either :) ), but it will be interesting
to see the "state-of-the-art" in analyzing linear probing.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 12 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 handout, A1 solutions posted</b><br>
The assignment 2 handout and the sample solutions for assignment 1 
have been posted to the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
Sorry about the delay!
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 4 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>CDF TA available</b><br>
A CDF TA will be available Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays throughout
the term to help you with any CDF- or computing-related issues.
See the
<a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?num=1180626636">CDF TA announcement</a>
on the Computer Science Community, or the cork board in BA2210.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Friday, 1 June 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Clarification for Q2</b><br>
I've posted a clarification to the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
</p>
<p>
<b>TA office hours</b><br>
The TA will hold office hours 4-6pm in BA2272 on Monday, June 4
(enter through the BA2270 lab).
Bring all your A1 questions.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 31 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Office hours</b><br>
I'll hold regular office hours Thursdays, 3-5pm in BA 4261.
I'm also available by appointment (just let me know some times you're
available to meet, and I'll set a time to meet with you or your group).<br>
I'm also planning to set some TA office hours prior to the due dates
of assignments and the tests, so watch for those announcements.
</p>
<p>
<b>Programming assignments: submit early and often!</b><br>
I shouldn't need to say this, but submit a copy of your programming assignments
early (to make sure you know how to use the submission system well before
the deadline, and that everything with the submission system is set up
correctly). Waiting until the last minute and encountering problems
is not grounds for extension!<br>
Along with this, submit new versions often as you're completing the assignment! 
That way, if something comes up and you're unable to complete or submit
your assignment at the deadline, at least you've handed in a partial solution
(and it's good support for requesting special consideration).
</p>

<p>
<b>Getting CDF accounts</b><br>
A few students have asked me about CDF accounts.
Links to the applicable CDF pages, and answers to other frequently asked
questions, are at the bottom of the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
If you have other questions not answered there,
be sure to email me and I'll get them answered.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 29 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Script for checking for new announcements</b><br>
One of your fellow students sent me a python script that he wants
to share with you. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote><q>
I am an RSS junkie, moreover, I'm lazy. As a result I have written a
small script that checks the course announcements for me (figured it
would be good practice), and was wondering if you could host it on the
website of students to download.
[Note] my use of the 'open' command which is
OS specific, but I'm sure everyone will figure that one out.
Other than that, simply schedule the thing in a cron like program and
you're done.
</q></blockquote>
<p>
Here's a link to his <a href="Check263.zip">Check263 Announcements</a>
script. I haven't checked it thoroughly, so I take no responsibility if
anything goes wrong with it should you decide to use it. You probably
need to read it anyway and change some file locations to fit your
own directory structure.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 27 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Assignment 1 posted</b><br>
The first assignment has now been posted to the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
Remember that the programming portion won't be collected
until a couple days later, so it's like a free extension.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 22 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>New course bulletin board</b><br>
I have set up a new <a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?board=CSC263H1Y">course bulletin board</a> for our use this summer.
Use it for general discussion about course material, past exams,
organizing study groups, etc. Simply use your CDF login and password
to access the posting features.
</p>

<h3>Monday, 21 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Help Centre this summer</b><br>
The <a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?num=1178743368">Help Centre</a> has a new location and hours this summer:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It will be in Bahen 2200 right from the start of the term -- Tuesday, May 22 (as announced already).
  <li>During the first week only, it will be open from 5 to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday.
  <li>After that, it will be open 4 to 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday.
</ul>

<p>
What's the best day to come? The Help Centre TAs say:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First year: Any day.
  <li>Programming: Any day.
  <li>Theory: Any day, but Wed and Thurs are best.
</ul>
<p>
Please remember the Help Centre when you need help!

<h3>Friday, 11 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>First lecture</b><br>
Unfortunately I will be out of town for our first class, but I've arranged
for another instructor to teach the class this week. 
The class (and tutorial) will be held as scheduled.
I'll be back at the end of the week, when I'll be happy to attend
to any waiver requests or other questions about the course.
</p>
<p>
<b>Requesting waivers</b><br>
If you have not satisfied the course prerequisites, you WILL be
removed from the course sometime in the future, unless you obtain a waiver.
Details on how to obtain a waiver are on the
<a href="admin/policies.html#waivers">Course Policies</a> page.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 9 May 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Tutorials start first week</b><br>
There will be a tutorial held this Tuesday, May 15.
It will be a review of proving worst-case running time and
asymptotic notation, slanted to getting you in practice for
solving the types of problems you'll see in this course.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 8 May 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Welcome!</b><br>
Welcome to CSC 263! All course announcements will be posted to this page,
in reverse chronological order. Be sure to check back often.
