<b>Unofficial grades posted</b><br>
I have posted unofficial grades on the online marks posting. 
Official grades will eventually be posted on ROSI, probably after the break.
Have a great holiday and all the best next term!

<b>Exam office hours</b><br>
I will be holding office hours during the exam period at the following times:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tuesday, December 11 at 1:00pm-3:00pm (after the Distinguished Lecture)
  <li>Friday, December 14 at 12:00noon-2:00pm
</ul>
<p>
All office hours will take place in BA 4261. Bring any questions (from
past exams, assignments, textbook) you want some help with.
You can also pick up any uncollected term work at these times (hopefully
w4 will be ready by Friday too).<br>
Remember, you can still email me, post to the course board, or ask for
an appointment if you have questions and can't make the above times.
</p>
<p>
<b>Distinguished Lecturer on Tuesday</b><br>
I know it's during exams, but if you have time, the following lecture should
be very interesting. We all know Al Gore invented the Internet, but Dr. Kahn
actually did a lot of the work. Here's a bit of his biography and the talk
details. It's not often you get to hear from one of the people who built
the Internet!
</p><p>
Robert Kahn will be the next speaker for our Distinguished Lecture series,
this coming Tuesday, December 11 at 11:00am in BA 1180. He will be
speaking on "Managing Digital Objects on the Net".
</p><p>
Dr. Kahn has had a distinguished career; in 1972 he demonstrated ARPANET,
for which he was a principal architect. After becoming Director of DARPA's
Information Preocessing Techniques Office, he started the United State's
billion dollar Strategic Computing Program, the largest computer research
and development program ever undertaken by the federal government.
In 2004 he shared ACM's Turing Award along with Vict Cerf for their design
of the TCP/IP protocol which is at the basis of the Internet. Among his many
other honours are the National Medal of Technology, presented by President
Clinton, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President Bush.
Dr. Kahn is now President of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives,
a not-for-profit organizaton which performs research on strategic development
of networked-based information techniques.

<b>w4 Q1b revised</b><br>
The original statement I wrote for Q1b is false. I have changed the
question so I now ask you to prove a correct statement.
Specifically, I've changed the second part of the iff to read
"v has a child s such that there is no back edge (u,w) such that 
u a descedant of s...."<br>
The handout has been updated.

<b>CDF unavailable this Friday evening</b><br>
The CDF's infrastructure needs to be brought down for important security updates on Friday, October 26, from 6:30pm to 9:30pm.  This will result in the entire CDF system being unavailable for the duration of the outage, including login access to the workstations and the compute servers, the web servers, etc.  Wireless network access for CDF accounts should be unaffected.  Please terminate any open local or remote sessions to the CDF's computers, and shut down any long-running processes by 6pm on Friday.
</p>
<p>
<b>p2 extension</b><br>
As discussed in class today, I'll accept p2 until 5:30pm on Monday, October 29.
Don't forget about our midterm Tuesday morning!
</p>
<p>
<b>Room for Midterm Test</b><br>
A reminder that the midterm test, scheduled for
Tuesday, October 30, will be written in SS 1083 (not the usual lecture room).
The test will take place during the usual lecture time.

<p>
<b>First faculty research seminar</b><br>
From <a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?num=1193104758">CS announcements</a>:<br>
A brief reminder that our first Faculty Research Seminar will take place on Tuesday, October 23, 4-5pm in room BA1200.  No registration required -- just show up at 4pm.<br>
Prof. Charles Rackoff will speak on "Computational Complexity and Cryptography".  His talk will be followed by pizza and pop and a chance to chat with him.
So take a small break from studying for midterms, grab a bite to eat, and find out about the field of cryptography from one of the top researchers in the area!
</p><p> 
Here is a short abstract from Prof. Rackoff:<br>
Computational Complexity involves questions about how efficiently certain problems can be solved.  It turns out that for some functions, every algorithm for the function must be extraordinarily inefficient.  Although this may seem like a bad thing, it is only because of this fact that secure cryptography might be possible.  However, because of deep open questions in computational complexity, we don't actually know whether or not there is any way to do cryptography securely.

You can access them using your CDF account login and password
on the <a href="https://www.cdf.toronto.edu/students/">CDF Secure Website</a>.
(This is the first time I'm using this system, so let me know of any problems!)
Be sure to let me know of any errors.

<b>Error in p1 code</b><br>
Some students have reported an error in the p1 starter code,
in the declaration of increaseElementPriority().
Please see the clarification on the BB or the assignments page.

<h3>Monday, 1 October 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>A1 programming question posted</b><br>
The programming question is now available. Please submit your code
electronically by 5:30pm on Tuesday, October 9 (note the extension).
If you choose to complete the programming question in a group, only
submit ONE copy with both your names inside the file.
</p>
<p>
<b>Programming assignments: submit early and often!</b><br>
I shouldn't need to say this, but submit a copy of your programming assignments
early (to make sure you know how to use the submission system well before
the deadline, and that everything with the submission system is set up
correctly). Waiting until the last minute and encountering problems
is not grounds for extension!<br>
Along with this, submit new versions often as you're completing the assignment! 
That way, if something comes up and you're unable to complete or submit
your assignment at the deadline, at least you've handed in a partial solution
(and it's good support for requesting special consideration).
</p>
<p>
<b>Room for Midterm Test</b><br>
Just some advance warning that the midterm test, scheduled for
October 30, will be written in SS 1083 (not the usual lecture room).
The test will take place during the usual lecture time.
I'll remind you again closer to the test date.

<p>
<b>Welcome!</b><br>
Welcome to CSC 263! All course announcements will be posted to this page,
in reverse chronological order. Be sure to check back often.
But first, a few pre-course announcements.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tutorials start first week</b><br>
There will be a tutorial held on Thursday, September 13.
It will be a review of proving worst-case running time and
asymptotic notation, slanted to getting you in practice for
solving the types of problems you'll see in this course.
</p>
<p>
<b>Requesting waivers</b><br>
If you have not satisfied the course prerequisites, you WILL be
removed from the course sometime in the future, unless you obtain a waiver.
Details on how to obtain a waiver are on the
<a href="admin/policies.html#waivers">Course Policies</a> page.
</p>
<p>
<b>Getting CDF accounts</b><br>
A few students have asked me about CDF accounts.
Links to the applicable CDF pages, and answers to other frequently asked
questions, are at the bottom of the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
If you have other questions not answered there,
be sure to email me and I'll get them answered.
</p>
<p>
<b>Script for checking for new announcements</b><br>
A former student wrote a python script that checks for new announcements.
He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote><q>
I am an RSS junkie, moreover, I'm lazy. As a result I have written a
small script that checks the course announcements for me (figured it
would be good practice), and was wondering if you could host it on the
website of students to download.
[Note] my use of the 'open' command which is
OS specific, but I'm sure everyone will figure that one out.
Other than that, simply schedule the thing in a cron like program and
you're done.
</q></blockquote>
<p>
Here's a link to his <a href="Check263.zip">Check263 Announcements</a>
script. I haven't checked it thoroughly, so I take no responsibility if
anything goes wrong with it should you decide to use it. You probably
need to read it anyway and change some file locations to fit your
own directory structure.
