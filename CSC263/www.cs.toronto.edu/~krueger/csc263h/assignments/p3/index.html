<h3>Programming question for Homework 3: Graphs and shortest paths</h3>
<h4>Part A</h4>

<p>
Design and implement Java classes for representing and manipulating
directed <b>multigraphs</b>.
A (multi)graph is determined by whether it is directed
or undirected, by the number of its nodes/vertices, and by the
(multi)set of its (possibly weighted) edges.
For this assignment, we only consider directed multigraphs and
the number of nodes are determined
when the graph is instantiated, and do not change during the lifetime
of the graph. The nodes of the graph are labeled by integers
0,1,..,(n-1), where n is the number of nodes. The set of edges of a
graph is not fixed. Initially, a graph contains no edges at all. A
graph implementation should support methods for inserting and removing
(weighted) edges. Multiple edges from the same source
to the same target node are allowed.
</p>
<p>
You should implement (parts of) two different representations:
one that uses an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> to store edges,
and one that uses <strong>adjacency lists</strong>.
<!--and one that stores edges in a single <strong>linked list of edges</strong>.-->
</p>

<h4>Part B</h4>

<p>
Implement a Java method that implements
<b>Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm</b>
of a given directed multigraph using a priority queue.
Your algorithm should be very similar to that described
on page 595 of your CLRS textbook.
The priority queue data structure you should use is the one
you implemented in Assignment 1,
namely your <code>TernaryHeap</code> class.
We are providing you a binary (i.e. class file) of a working
implementation of the <code>TernaryHeap</code>  class
in case there were problems with your solution. Remember
that this class needs the <code>PriorityComparator</code> interface,
so put a copy of <code>PriorityComparator.class</code> in your working
directory (this is just the file 
<code>PriorityComparator.java</code> compiled from Assignment 1).
</p>

<p>To mark your assignment, we will test your code using
<strong>our own secret</strong> tester routine.
Successfully running the <code>GraphTester</code> class we provide does <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> guarantee that your code is
correct or will pass our marking tester routine.
You are encouraged to derive your own test cases.
Your code may be tested with an auto-marker routine and/or by TA
inspection to check that your routines are implemented correctly.
<!--Each method
gets 5
marks if it works correctly,
and gets 0 marks otherwise.-->
</p>

<p>
Note that you will be extending your solution for this assignment
for Assignment 4, so it will be beneficial to follow good programming
practices.

<hr>
<p>For more details, including exact specifications of the
methods that you should implement, see the starter code. All of your
work must be done inside the <code>AdjMatrixGraph</code>,
<code>AdjListsGraph</code> and <code>Dijkstra</code> classes,
where indicated by comments that start with: "<code>// TODO:</code>".
You may also add appropriate private instance variables or helper
methods.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Submission Instructions</span>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Submit your code <span style="font-weight: bold;">using the
"submit" mechanism on CDF </span>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">by
5:30pm on the due date)</span>. The <a href="http://www.cdf.utoronto.ca/workathome/">CDF FAQ</a>
contains general instructions for submitting your code electronically
(under the "Submitting Work" section). </li>
  <br>
  <li>Submit <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> three .java files 
<code>AdjMatrixGraph.java</code>,
<code>AdjListsGraph.java</code> and <code>Dijkstra.java</code>
(after you have implemented the missing parts) to the directory called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PGM3</span>.
All the code that you implement should be inside these files.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Do not submit any other files, and in particular, do not submit
any class files. If you do, we will delete them before we compile
your code.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> submit any
printout of the code.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Do not rename the files, or any of the methods and
variables found in our starter code.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Write your name, student number
and CDF username in a comment at the top of the&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">Dijkstra.java</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> file.
If you have a partner, you should also
write the corresponding information about your partner.</span></li>
  <br>
  <li>We will compile your code and test it using
our own secret tester code (which is similar to, but more thorough than,
the tester code that we provide as part of the starter code).</li>
  <br>
  <li>Your code must compile and run on the CDF Unix/Linux system.
Test it there! Programs that do not
compile and run
get 0 marks.</li>
</ol>
