<h3>Programming question for Homework 2: AVL Trees</h3>
<p>Implement a dictionary class.
The dictionary should be implemented as
a height-balanced balanced binary search tree (an <i>AVL tree</i>),
encapsulated in a class called&nbsp;<code>AVLTree</code>. 
<!--The tree used to represent the dictionary is stored 
in a collection of instances of the <code>Node</code> class.-->
The provided starter code implements an ordinary binary search tree;
you must revise this code to implement an AVL tree.
Your implementation should be consistent with the algorithms described in
the "AVL tree notes" handout posted on the course website.
</p>

<p>
This implementation of an AVL tree will use a simplified
<code>Node</code> class to store information at each node of the tree.
Each node will store a <var>key</var> and
<var>data</var> of generic types, references to the <var>parent</var>,
<var>left</var> child and <var>right</var> child, and an
integer balance factor <var>bf</var>.
</p>

<p>
You should implement the following methods of the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">AVLTree</span> class (described in the
starter code):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>singleLeftRotation()</code></li>
  <li><code>singleRightRotation()</code></li>
  <li><code>doubleRightLeftRotation()</code></li>
  <li><code>doubleLeftRightRotation()</code></li>
  <li><code>balance()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
You should also alter the following methods of the
<code>AVLTree</code> class to support the update of node balance factors
and, when necessary, appropriately call the <code>balance()</code> method:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>treeInsert()</code></li>
  <li><code>delete()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>delete()</code> may require significant rewriting.
During an insert or delete, all necessary updates of node balance
factors must be completed
in <strong>O(log <var>n</var>)</strong> total time, 
where <var>n</var> is the number of nodes in the tree following
the operation.
The worst-case time complexity of <code>balance()</code>
and each of the rotation methods should be <strong>O(1)</strong>.
</p>

<p>To mark your assignment, we will test the above methods using
<strong>our own secret</strong> tester routine.
Successfully running the <code>AVL</code> class we provide does <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> guarantee that your code is
correct or will pass our marking tester routine.
You are encouraged to derive your own test cases.
Your code may be tested with an auto-marker routine and/or by TA
inspection to check that your routines are implemented correctly (as
described in the comments or the "AVL tree nodes" handout) and
in the correct time bounds.
<!--Each method
gets 5
marks if it works correctly,
and gets 0 marks otherwise.-->
</p>
<!--Each one of
these four procedures gets 5 marks if it works correctly,
and gets 0 marks otherwise.<br>-->
<hr>
<p>For more details, including exact specifications of the
methods that you should implement, see the starter code. All of your
work must be done inside the <code>AVLTree</code> class,
where indicated by comments that start with: "<code>// TODO:</code>".
You may also add appropriate private instance variables or helper
methods.</p>

<p>
Starter code:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="AVLTree.java"><code>AVLTree.java</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="Node.java"><code>Node.java</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The code in <code>AVL.java</code> creates an AVL tree and executes
basic operations on it. The sequence of operations and their arguments are
read from the input in the form of user-defined commands. The commands
supported are add, delete, search and print.
This class may be useful for testing your code.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Submission Instructions</span>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Submit your code <span style="font-weight: bold;">using the
"submit" mechanism on CDF </span>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">by
5:30pm on the due date)</span>. The <a href="http://www.cdf.utoronto.ca/workathome/">CDF FAQ</a>
contains general instructions for submitting your code electronically
(under the "Submitting Work" section). </li>
  <br>
  <li>Submit <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> the .java
file&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">AVLTree.java</span>
of the starter code (after
you have implemented the missing parts) to the directory called <span style="font-weight: bold;">PGM2</span>.
All the code that you
implement should be inside this file.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Do not submit any other files, and in particular, do not submit
any
class files. If you do, we will delete them before we compile
your code.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> submit any
printout of the code. </li>
  <br>
  <li>Do not rename the file&nbsp;<code>AVLTree.java</code>, or any
of the methods and
variables found in our starter code.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Write your name, student number
and CDF username in a comment at
the
top of the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">AVLTree.java</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> file</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> If you have a partner, you should also
write the corresponding information about your partner.</span></li>
  <br>
  <li>We will compile your code by typing 
"<code>javac&nbsp;AVLTree.java</code>" <!--and
"<code>javac&nbsp;.java</code>",--> and we
will test
the
resulting .class file(s) using our own tester code (which is similar
to, but more thorough than,
the
tester code that we provide as part of the starter code).</li>
  <br>
  <li>Your code must compile and run on the CDF Unix/Linux system.
Test it there! Programs that do not
compile and run
get 0 marks.</li>
</ol>
