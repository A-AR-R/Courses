<H1>Combinatorics Seminar Series</H1>

<p>
Welcome to the University of Toronto <i>combinatorics seminar</i> web site.
This seminar series, held jointly by the
<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Department of Computer Science</a>
and the <a href="http://www.math.utoronto.ca">Department of Mathematics</a>,
discusses recent developments in applied discrete mathematics, including,
but not limited to, problems in combinatorial theory, graph theory,
and their algorithms. We invite researchers from around the University,
around the province, and around the world to present their latest work.
</p>
<p>
The combinatorics seminar is traditionally held weekly on Friday
afternoons, from 1pm to 2pm, in
room 266 of the D.L. Pratt building (6 King's College Road, Toronto)
on the University of Toronto downtown campus. You may find this
<a href="http://oracle.osm.utoronto.ca/map/">campus map</a> useful; the
Pratt building is labelled PT near the bottom. Occasionally we depart
from this tradition, but any differences will be distinguished.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to be added to the combinatorics announcement and
discussion mailing list, or to schedule a talk by yourself or one of
your visitors, please contact the coordinators. For the 2003-2004 year,
the coordinator is Mike Molloy who can be contacted at
molloy in cs.toronto.edu.

<h4>
Complexity of locally constrained graph homomorphisms
</h4>
<p class=name>
Jan Kratochvil<br>
Charles University, Prague
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
Graph homomorphism is an edge preserving vertex mapping between two
graphs. This algebraically motivated notion is also a natural
generalization of the graph coloring concept - a k-coloring of a graph
G is a homomorphism from G into the complete graph on k vertices. From the
complexity point of view, the H-homomorphism problem is well understood.
This problem, parametrized by a (fixed) graph H, asks when an input graph
G allows a homomorphism into H. It is also referred to as the H-coloring
problem. As Hell and Nesetril proved, this problem is polynomially solvable
when H is bipartite and NP-complete otherwise.
<p>
A similar question will be discussed for locally constrained homomorphisms,
i.e., homomorphisms for which the neighborhood of every vertex needs to be
mapped bijectively/injectively/surjectively into/onto the neighborhood of
its image. Interesting relations to topological graph theory and to the
generalized frequency assignment problem will be presented. The latter is   
also referred to as the distance-constrained graph labeling problem, since
it asks for a labeling of the vertices of the input graph by nonnegative
integers such that the labels assigned to vertices which are close to each
other differ by at least a certain specified amount. Several complexity
results on this problem, including the complexity of L(2,1)-labeling
regular graphs and L(p,q)-labeling prelabeled trees will be surveyed.

<h4>
Monotonicity issues in search and conquest games on graphs
</h4>
<p class=name>
Dimitrios M. Thilikos<br>
Departament de Llenguatges i Systemes Informatics<br>
Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,<br>
Barcelona, Spain
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
 In this talk we present the games of conquest and searching in graphs.  The
 goal in these games is to systematically maneuver several searches in
 order to capture an omniscient fugitive who flees around the graph.
 Such games have several applications in network security where
 we need to clean a computer network that is ``contaminated'' by
 mobile viruses or eavesdroppers. We describe the computational
 complexity of these games, and their connections to graph-theoretic
 parameters. In particular, we consider the "recontamination question":
<p>
 Is it possible to search/conquest a graph using fewer searchers if we
 allow retreat, i.e., if the fugitive can visit an already searched
 location?
<p>
 We present a structural theorem providing conditions for a negative answer
 to this question and describe its consequences and applications. The basic
 idea of the proof is to determine the structures defining strategies of
 "efficient resistance" that can be applied no matter whether the
 search/conquest strategy includes retreat or not. Finally, we present an
 example of a search game in which the answer to the recontamination
 question is positive and we evaluate the benefits of retreat in trees and
 in general graphs for this type of search game.

<h4>
An Approximate Max-Steiner-Tree-Packing Min-Steiner-Cut Theorem
</h4>
<p class=name>
Lap Chi Lau<br>
Dept of Computer Science<br>
University of Toronto
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
Given an undirected multigraph G and a subset of vertices S,
the Steiner Tree Packing problem is to find a largest collection of
edge-disjoint trees that each connects S. This problem and its
generalization have attracted considerable attention from researchers in
different areas because of their wide applicability. This problem was
shown to be APX-hard (no polytime approximation scheme unless P=NP).
In fact, prior to this work, not even an approximation algorithm with
asymptotic ratio better than O(n) was known.
<p>
In this talk, we present the first polynomial time constant factor
approximation algorithm for the Steiner Tree Packing problem. The main
theorem is an approximate min-max relation between the minimum size of an
edge-cut that disconnects some vertices in S (i.e. S-cut) and the maximum
number of edge-disjoint trees that each connects S (i.e. S-trees).
Specifically, we prove that if the minimum S-cut in G has k edges, then G
has at least k/26 edge-disjoint S-trees; this answers Kriesell's
conjecture affirmatively up to a constant multiple. The techniques that
we use are purely combinatorial, where matroid theory is the underlying
ground work.

<h4>
Large near-optimal Golomb rulers, a computational search for
the verification of Erd&ouml;s conjecture on Sidon sets
</h4>
<p class=name>
Apostolos Dimitromanolakis<br>
Dept of Computer Science<br>
University of Toronto
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
Golomb rulers are sets of positive integers having a unique difference
between any two numbers in the set. The goal is to find an optimal
Golomb ruler which has the smallest possible largest element for a
specified numer of marks (elements of the set). It is not only a very
interesting combinatorial problem but also has many applications in
engineering as well. The same problem with a different notation can also
be found under the Sidon set or B_2 sequence name which is more common
among the mathematicians. Finding an optimal Golomb ruler is a very
difficult combinatorial problem and although it has not been proven to
be NP-hard, no polynomial algorithms exists for finding an optimal
ruler.  Optimal rulers are known today for up to 24 marks and are all of
sub-quadratic length. Indeed, a conjecture by Erd&ouml;s and Atkinson
(independently) states that sub-quadratic length rulers exist for any
number of marks. Previous works were able to verify this for up to 150
marks. In this talk we will present how we were able to verify the
conjecture for Golomb rulers having up to 65000 marks and at the same
time produce a vast amount of near-optimal rulers useful in
applications.
