<h4>
Simple elimination orderings of strongly chordal graphs
</h4>
<p class=name>
Joe Sawada<br>
University of Toronto
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:<br>
A graph is strongly chordal if and only if it has a simple elimination
ordering (SEO) of its vertices.  We focus on two interesting questions
about a strongly chordal graph G:
<p>
(1) How fast can we find an SEO of G?
<p>
(2) How fast can we list all SEOs of G?
<p>
Currently, strongly chordal graphs cannot be recognized in linear time -
despite a recent claim to the contrary.  We show that if we can find
an SEO for G in linear time then we can also recognize strongly chordal
graphs in linear time.
<p>
If there is time, we will discuss the second question.
In particular, the set of all SEOs of a strongly chordal graph correspond
to the basic words of a related antimatroid.  By discovering a constant time
transposition "oracle" we can use an existing Gray code algorithm to list
all SEO's in constant amortized time.

Bicoloured Recursive trees and Eulerian Numbers
</h4>
<p class=name>
Amram Meir<br>
Department of Mathematics and Statistics<br>
York University
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:   The nodes of every non-trivial tree can be partitioned
into two classes, A and B,  such that no two nodes of the same class
are joined. Given a family F of trees , let Y(n,k) = Y(n,k; F) denote
the number of trees T in F such that the classes A and B of T have k
and n-k nodes , respectively;  and let Y(n) denote the total number of
trees T in F having n nodes. The ratios Y(n,k) / Y(n), and, in
particular, the ratio r(n) =Y(n,n/2) / Y(n)
for even values of n , are of interest.
<p>
Asymptotic results for  Simply Generated families (including rooted
labelled, binary, etc.) trees were obtained by us (1999), and  for
unlabelled-unrooted  trees more recently by Pippenger (2001).
<p>
Here we consider the asymptotic behaviour of Y(n,k) / Y(n) for
Recursive Trees.
<p>
This is joint work with J.W. Moon (University of Alberta).

Searching for cliques and clusters in large graphs
</h4>
<p class=name>
Rudi Mathon<br>
Department of Computer Science<br>
University of Toronto
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
A new algorithm will be described for finding subgraphs with
a specified number of edges in a given graph. We employ a
randomized strategy based on restricted local search.
<p> 
The algorithm has been successfully tested to find<br>
(i) maximum cliques in 3 classes of random graphs with up to
    100000 vertices,<br>
(ii) maximum independent sets in block intersection graphs
     yielding Steiner t-designs<br>
(iii) extremal regular subgraphs in strongly regular graphs
     to be used as switching sets to new sr-graphs<br>
(iv) subgraphs of a given size with the maximum number of
     edges in random multigraphs of a given density with
     applications to clustering analysis in networks and
     systems.

<h4>
Drawing Venn Diagrams
</h4>
<p class=name>
Frank Ruskey<br>
Department of Computer Science<br>
University of Victoria
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:  
 Venn diagrams have long been used as an aid in understanding set
 containment relationships and in certain logical arguments.
 By extending in a natural way the familiar 3 circle Venn diagram
 interesting graph theoretic, combinatorial, and geometrical
 questions arise.  This talk is a survey  of what is known about
 Venn diagrams, particularly the aesthetic and extremal
 properties of the drawings, including recent results about symmetric
 and minimum area Venn diagrams.  The talk is at the advanced
 undergraduate level and includes many beautiful illustrations.

Packing Steiner Trees
</h4>
<p class=name>
Mohammad Salavatipour<br>
Department of Computer Science<br>
University of Toronto
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
The Steiner packing problem is to find the maximum number of edge-disjoint
subgraphs of a given graph $G$ that connect a given set of required points
$S$. This problem is motivated by practical applications in VLSI-layout
and broadcasting, as well as theoretical reasons. In this paper, we study
this problem and present an algorithm with an asymptotic approximation
factor of $|S|/4$. This gives a sufficient condition for the existence of
$k$ edge-disjoint Steiner trees in a graph in terms of the
edge-connectivity of the graph. We will show that this condition is
the best possible if the number of terminals is 3. At the end, we consider
the fractional version of this problem, and observe that it can be reduced
to the minimum Steiner tree problem via the ellipsoid algorithm.

<p class=abstract>
Abstract: (tentative)<br>

In this paper, he and J. Mandler determine the precise
value of the 3-XOR-SAT threshold.  I.e., they determine
a constant t, such that a uniformly random instance of 3-XOR-SAT
on n variables and cn clauses is almost surely satisfiable
for c&lt;t and is almost surely unsatisfiable for c&gt;t.

<h4>
Isomorphic Factorizations of Trees
</h4>
<p class=name>
Robert Jamison<br>
Department of Mathematical Sciences<br>
Clemson University
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
An <i>isomorphic factorization</i> of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a partition
of the edge set $E$ into parts which determine isomorphic subgraphs of $G$.
It is often convenient to think of the parts of the partition as
color classes of edges.  Thus one can also speak of an
isomorphic factorization of $G$ into $k$ parts as an
<i>isomorphic $k$-coloring</i> of $G$.  We also say that a graph $G$
<i>$k$-splits</i> if it has an isomorphic $k$-coloring
<p>
An obvious necessary condition, called the Divisibility Condition,
for a graph $G$ to $k$-split is that $k$ divides the number
of edges $e(G)$ of $G$.
Under certain circumstances, this simple condition is also sufficient.
This is the case<br>
1) for certain regular graphs, including the complete graphs,<br>
2) when $e(G) = 2k$,<br>
and 3) when $k \ge \chi'(G)$, the edge chromatic number of $G$.
<p>
This talk will focus on <i>non-obvious</i> necessary conditions for
certain classes of caterpillars  (trees obtained by adding a collection
of ``hairs'' to a path ``spine'') to $k$-split.  In particular, a
complete
analysis will be given for several types of caterpillar, where the
necessary and sufficient conditions are seen to be number-theoretic in
nature.

<h4>
A Graph-Theoretic Approach to Polynomial-Time Recognition
with the Lambek Calculus
</h4>
<p class=name>
Gerald Penn<br>
Department of Computer Science<br>
University of Toronto
</p>
<p class=abstract>
Abstract:
The Lambek calculus is a substructural logic, lacking the classical
rules of weakening, exchange, and permutation.  We will consider the
question:
<p align=center>
 "Is the sequent A1...An |- B derivable in the Lambek Calculus?"
<p>
 where A1,...,An,B are (possibly implicational) types.  In
 computational linguistics, these types are syntactic categories
 assigned to words by a lexicon.  Given an LCG, G, and a string w1...wn,
 with unique types, A1...An, given by G's lexicon, this amounts to
 string recognition when B=s (sentence), the distinguished category of
 G.  Although the string languages recognisable by LCGs are known to be
 weakly equivalent to the context-free languages, no polynomial-time
 decision procedure for this question is known.
<p>
 This talk seeks to contribute to this issue by presenting a simple
 graph-theoretic construction for representing the well-formedness
 constraints of an LCG derivation, reminiscent of Girard's (1987) "long
 trip condition" for proof nets in linear logic.  An algorithm
 resembling a standard CFG chart-parser is also provided for answering
 the above sequent derivability question.  Crucially, this algorithm
 takes exponential time in the worst case, so it does not put the
 matter to rest.
<p>
By contrast, much of the recent work on parsing with LCGs has chosen
to dwell on elegant implementations of LCG proof search in
higher-order logic programming languages.  While these are indeed
elegant, they are perhaps not the best choice for discovering the
complexity of the problem at hand.  It is for this reason that we opt
for a ``back-to-basics'' approach, using only a few simple algorithms
and basic graph theory to characterise the problem.  Given our
extensive knowledge about algorithmic efficiency and NP-completeness
in the domain of graph theory, it is hoped either that the algorithm
given here can be enhanced and proven to be polynomial, or that a
failure to so enhance it will reveal an embedding of a known NP-hard
problem into LCG recognition.

<h4>
Graph representations and distance labeling problems<br>
</h4>
<p class=name>
Christophe Paul<br>
LIRMM, Montpellier
</p>
<p class=abstract>  
Abstract:  The central question we are interested in is:  "How to encode
information about a graph in such a way that an oracle is able to answer
queries on that graph?"
<p>
Queries can deal with such issues as adjacency, connectivity, distances in
graphs and comparability, least common ancestors in posets.  There are
various types of representations such as centralized or distributed. As
usual, we have to deal with the tradeoff between time and space: time for
the query answer, space for the size of the encoding.
<p>
After presenting general considerations on graph representations, we will
talk about results on encodings that enable the oracle to answer queries
about distances, namely a "distance labeling scheme". Various schemes for
a number of graph classes will be presented.
