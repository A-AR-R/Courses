<b>Final exam notes</b><br>
I've posted some notes about the final exam on the <a href="exams">Exams</a>
page. Please note that the exam is <i>closed-book</i> and
<i>will not be testing</i> syntax memorization.
I'll add notes to this page as people ask me questions.

<b>Office hours</b><br>
Today's office hour will be as normal, 11:30-12:30.
I might be around in the afternoon as well.<br>
Next week, I will hold an extended pre-exam office hour on Monday afternoon, 3-5pm.
</p>

<h3>Monday, 10 April 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A5 extension, no late assignments</b><br>
Since the last assignment must be handed by the last day of classes (Tuesday), 
I can't accept late assignments except on an individual basis.
In compensation, I'll make A5 due Tuesday night (24 hour extension)
but with no late assignments (unless you talk to me).
</p>
<p><b>Additional detail for Part 3</b><br>
I've added some more detail for what I'm expecting for part 3 of the
assignment. This (and some clarifications) are posted on the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
</p>
<p><b>Study/exam week office hours</b><br>
My office hours will be changing for study and exam week.
I'll post them here once I've figured them out (this is also an ideal time
to email me to request specific times).
Wednesday April 12 will be a normal office hour, though I'll need to leave
right at 12:30.

<b>New "blog" discussion group available</b><br>
Computing services has set up a new forum for CSC324 on the UTM Blogger.
Log on to <a href="https://blog.erin.utoronto.ca/blog/">UTM Blogger</a>
with your UTM login and go to the CSC324H5 group.
</p><p>
You may use this as a discussion group to talk about the assignments and
ask questions. Students will be able to answer questions, as I will.
Access is restricted to members of the class, but postings are public,
so don't post code or pieces from your own assignment (that could be an
academic offense, instead directly email me such questions).
</p>
<p><b>Prolog resources</b><br>
I have put a few more links to Prolog resources on the
<a href="resources">Resources</a> page.
They should help you get started on (and finish) your assignment.
</p>

<b>Dynamic knowledge updates: <tt>assert</tt> and <tt>retract</tt></b><br>
In class today I inadvertently skipped over the dynamic predicates section.
It's in the lecture 11 notes under "Manipulating the Knowledge Base"
on the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 26 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Assignment 4 posted</b><br>
Assignment 4 is available from the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a>
page. Links to some Prolog tutorials are available from the
<a href="resources">Resources</a> page, and the tutorial notes are
available on the Lectures page to help get you started.

other really useful links, and I'll add them to the web page.

<b>A1 marking notes</b><br>
Information on A1 marking (reading the autotesting report, marking scheme
breakdown) are now posted to <a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
(<a href="assignments/a1/marking.html">direct link</a>).
</p>
<p><b>Why Scheme?</b><br>
Joel Spolsky's article,
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">
  The Perils of JavaSchools</a>,
gives an interesting perspective as to why we teach languages other than Java,
including an interesting observation about how functional programming has
helped Google solve massive scalability issues.
</p>

<p>
<b>Naur wins this year's Turing Award</b><br>
Peter Naur, one of the pioneers of programming language design,
has won the
<a href="http://campus.acm.org/public/pressroom/press_releases/3_2006/turing_3_01_2006.cfm">2005 Turing Award</a>.
The Turing Award is the "Nobel Prize of Computing."
</p>
<p>
We have seen many of his ideas already in the course, in relation to
functional programming.
We will be studying his best known contribution, Backus-Naur Form (BNF),
a formal way of specifying programming language syntax which he used to
specify Algol 60, later in the course.

<b>MT marks posted</b><br>

A1 marks should be available soon.

<b>Midterms to be returned Friday</b><br>
The midterms will be returned in tutorial on Friday. I'll have the
left-overs for return at lecture on Monday. The test was well done,
with a 25/35 average (not that an average means much).
A solution will be posted on the <a href="exams">Exams</a> page on Monday.
</p>

<p>
<b>A2 hints and clarifications</b><br>

if you get stuck on something!
</p>

<h3>Sunday, 26 February 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Newsgroup</b><br>
Several students have been asking me for a discussion group for the course.
The downtown version of the course is using the <tt>ut.cdf.csc324h</tt>
newsgroup. Since we're using the same assignments, it's a good place to
ask and discuss assignment-related questions. If you have questions regarding
lecture material, make sure you identify yourself as a UTM student (and
I'll try to answer it) or email me.
</p>

  <li>Wednesday, February 22 -- 10:00am to 11:00am (<i>earlier</i> than usual)

<b>Reading Week office hours</b><br>
I will not be holding my regular office hours during Reading Week.
I am trying to set up some special office hours during the break, so
check back here for announcements or email me.
</p>

<h3>Friday, 13 February 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 and midterm</b><br>

The midterm date is unchanged, set for February 27. Watch the Exams page
for more information regarding the exam.
</p>

<h3>Wednesday, 25 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Two tutorial sections</b><br>
We'll be running two tutorial sections (both on Friday, and both with
the same TA):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>3pm-4pm in NE 236, and
  <li>4pm-5pm in NE 286
</ul>
<p>
The two tutorials will generally cover the same material, so either go to
one or the other.
I expect the 4pm tutorial will have less students attending, so you'll
probably be able to ask more questions and get more individual attention
if you attend that one.
</p>

<p>
<b>A1 hints</b><br>

<h3>Thursday, 19 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Tutorial this week</b><br>
This week we will be holding the first tutorial.
The TA will be covering basic examples in Scheme to help you
get more comfortable with functional programming.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 16 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Scheme interpreters for home</b><br>
DrScheme and MzScheme should be installed in the <tt>cslinux</tt> labs.
They are available for download on the Internet if you wish to try them
on your own computer (versions for Windows, Mac and Linux appear available);
I've added links to the <a href="resources">Resources</a> page.<br>
I haven't tried running this software on your home computer, so I can't
help if you have problems. And remember that your programming assignments
must work on the UTM system, so if you choose to work on your own machine,
test it here before submitting.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 11 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Course resources</b><br>
I have posted a list of reference books and textbooks related to the
course on the <a href="resources">Resources</a> page.<br>
The Resources page also includes a number of online Scheme resources
which may be useful.
</p>
