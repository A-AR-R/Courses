<h2><a name="a5">Assignment 5</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assignment handout:
  <a href="a5/a5.html">HTML</a><br>
  Your code must run on the <tt>cslinux.utm</tt> system.
  <li>Now Due Tuesday, April 11 by 8:00pm (really 11:30pm), no late assignments.
  <li>A good <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~kris/learn-prolog-now/html/node54.html#lecture7">Definite Clause Grammars (DCG) tutorial</a> reference.
  <li><i>Clarification:</i> In your grammar you may assume there only 4 blocks
  in the world, named <tt>a,b,c,d</tt>, and a <tt>table</tt>.
  Even if you choose to use blocks2 (just make sure you have the same default
  initial world). Be aware that it's probably easier if you don't hard-code
  it in your grammar, though.
  <li><i>Clarification:</i> You may submit helper files, including
  <tt>blocks1.pl</tt>, if you so choose. We won't be marking the blocks
  world per se for this assignment, but you might find you need some minor
  modifications to your code to get it working right. (For example, you
  might need to add some cuts even though it worked perfectly the way
  is was used in A4.)
  <li>For Part II, each of the scripts mentioned should be accepted
  (and interpreted correctly) by your grammar. You should also accept
  at least one alternate way of saying the same thing.<br>
  For Part III, demonstrate that your grammar accepts both the provided
  script (and executes it correctly) and your alternative form.
  For example, you might exhibit both
  "<tt>Which block is on top of a?</tt>" and
  "<tt>What is on top of block b?</tt>"
  to demonstrate the provided question idiom <tt>q</tt>.
  You don't have to demonstrate all forms your grammar accepts, just
  a couple interesting examples.<br>
  Organize your transcript (perhaps annotated with comments) to make it easy
  for the marker to read and understand.
</ul>

<h3>Assignment 5 submission details</h3>

<p>
Submit to the
<a href="http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/submit">UTM submit system</a>
the following two Prolog source files:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>blocks5.pl</tt> - Prolog code for your assignment.
  <b>Be sure to include your basic blocks world code in this file!</b>
  <li><tt>transcript.txt</tt> - transcript of user interaction with your Prolog program
</ul>
<p>
You do not have to include <tt>read_line.pl</tt>, as you shouldn't need
to change it.
<p>
Include your name and student number in comments at the top of each file.
(Recall that Prolog comments start with <tt>/*</tt> and end with <tt>*/</tt>,
or go from <tt>%</tt> to the end of the line.)
Include any helper code in your submitted files.
</p>

<h3>Assignment 3 submission details</h3>

<p>
We will again be using the 
<a href="http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/submit">UTM submit system</a>
for electronic submission of your source code.<br>
Please put your solutions in the following two files:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>throwing.scm</tt> - solution to question 1
  <li><tt>mimic.cc</tt> - solution to question 2

<h2><a name="a2">Assignment 2</a></h2>

  <li><a href="a2.pdf">Assignment handout (PDF)</a>
  <a href="a2.ps">(PS)</a>
  <a href="a2/a2.html">(HTML)</a>

  <li><a href="a2/a2q3tests.txt">Tests for Q3 (<tt>cond*</tt>)</a>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment 2 submission details</h3>

<p>
We will again be using the 
<a href="http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/submit">UTM submit system</a>
for electronic submission of your source code.<br>
Please put your solutions in the following nine files:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>sum.scm</tt> - solution to question 1
  <li><tt>free.scm</tt> - solution to question 2
  <li><tt>cond.scm</tt> - solution to question 3
  <li><tt>proposition.scm</tt> - solutions to all parts of question 4
  <li><tt>cq.scm</tt> - solution to question 5(a)
  <li><tt>class-b.scm</tt> - solution to question 5(b)
  <li><tt>class-c.scm</tt> - solution to question 5(c)
  <li><tt>class-d.scm</tt> - solution to question 5(b)
  <li><tt>class-e.scm</tt> - solution to question 5(e)
</ul>
<p>
If you want to use procedures from one of the files in another file,
use <tt>load</tt>. When we test the code we'll make sure the files are
in the same load path so that <tt>load</tt> can find them.
To load (into the current execution) everything defined in another file, write:
</p>
<pre>(load "otherfile.scm")</pre>
<p>
This is also a good way to organize your own testing: put the tests in
another file and load the file with the procedures you want to test.
