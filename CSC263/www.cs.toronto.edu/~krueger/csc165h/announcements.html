<b>Final exam rules</b><br>
Finals is an exciting time of the year (and by "exciting" I mean "stressful
for most students"). You have probably all seen the old college movies where
the characters are coming up with bizarre schemes to cheat on the final exam.
Unfortunately, truth is just as strange as fiction (and sometimes stranger),
meaning the Faculty has to strictly enforce some pretty strict rules.
PLEASE be aware
of the exam rules so you don't inadvertently get into trouble!
</p><p>
Also, be aware that the Faculty of Arts and Science runs the final exams,
so I have little or no influence if a rule gets broken, so be careful.
The penalties are harsh to discourage cheating, but then unintentially
breaking a rule can be a major problem.
The faculty sent me the following highlights (slightly paraphrased for
our class) to try to ensure you won't accidentally break a rule, but be
sure to read the <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/undergraduate/exams/rules">full rules</a> on the Faculty website before your first exam:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Electronic devices of any kind, including cell phones and
  calculators, are not permitted at
  the exam. They are considered to be unauthorized aids, and
  possession of an unauthorized aid is an academic offence. Any such
  aids will be confiscated and the student reported to the Dean's
  Office. Please instruct students to leave ALL electronic devices at
  home or the side of the room, and please tell them to bring a watch
  or travel clock for time-keeping purposes and NOT a cell phone.
  [I'll write major timestones (like milestones, but times) on the
  board if possible, or you can always put up your hand and ask for
  the time during the exam.]
  <li>Study notes of ANY
  kind are not permitted once an examination has started,
  and you must make sure that
  you do not have any notes in your pencil cases, calculators,
  pockets or written on their hands.
  <li>Listen to the exam
  announcements and stop writing when told to do so. If you do not,
  students who continue to write their exams
  AFTER the end of the exam will be reported to the Dean's 
  Office and face a penalty.
</ol>
<p>
The final exam is run by a chief presiding officer from the Faculty,
and my role is only to answer any questions about the exam.
They have to strictly apply the rules (unfortunately necessary due to
some innovative cheaters), so just be sure you know and are following
the rules, and you'll be fine. Be smart.
</p><p>
Here's an example of
a case last year involving two friends who were communicating. They may just been rolling their eyes as if to say "this test is stupid/annoying, ha ha", but there was obviously communication going on and they got charged. Unfortunately it's completely untenable to have a rule which says that communication is allowed iff it's not on the topic of the exam. So people who can't help communicating should take care not to sit near each other.

<b>Exam office hours</b><br>
I will be holding office hours during the exam period at the following times:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tuesday, December 11 at 1:00pm-3:00pm
  <li>Friday, December 14 at 11:00am-12:00noon
  <li>Tuesday, December 18 at 12:00noon-2:00pm
</ul>
<p>
All office hours will take place in BA 4261. Bring any questions (from
past exams, assignments, textbook) you want some help with.
You can also pick up any uncollected term work at these times (including
quiz 10).<br>
Remember, you can still email me, post to the course board, or ask for
an appointment if you have questions and can't make the above times.
