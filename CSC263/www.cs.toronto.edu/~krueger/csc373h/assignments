<h2><a name="hw4">Assignment 4</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="hw4.pdf">Assignment handout (PDF)</a>
  <a href="hw4.ps">(PS)</a>
  <li>Due at start of tutorial on Friday, April 7.
  <li><i>Typo:</i> At the end of the question 4 introduction,
  <i>S</i> should be defined as the
  sum of <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> 
  (not the sum of <i>s<sub>i</sub></i>).
  The online version has been corrected.
  <li><i>Clarification:</i> For question 1, the definition of <i>d(C)</i>
  mentions the "cost" of edges without being specific: there are two
  notions of cost that we could mean (<i>d(e)</i> or <i>d(e)*f(e)</i>).
  Fortunately, only one of these notions makes sense in the context of the
  rest of the question. We leave it up to you to think about it and figure
  out the correct interpretation.<br>
  In the definition of an augmenting cycle, the handout talks about the
  corresponding undirected network -- this is just saying that <i>C</i>
  is a is a cycle if we ignore the directions on the edge (or analogously,
  is a cycle in the residual network).
  <li>For question 2, it is acceptable to have exponentially many
  constraints in your integer program (as a function of the number of
  nodes in the graph). Also, you may find it helpful to consider subsets of
  vertices and circuits in the graph, and to think about the ways in which
  edges in the circuits interact with the subsets of vertices (of course,
  your goal is to use this idea to write down linear constraints that ensure
  any solution to your integer program yields a circuit in the graph).

  made some adjustments)

<h2><a name="hw3">Assignment 3</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="hw3.pdf">Assignment handout (PDF)</a>
  <a href="hw3.ps">(PS)</a>
  <li>Due at start of tutorial on Friday, March 17.
  <li>Be sure to show your work for question 1, and justify the correctness
  and running time of your algorithms.
  <li>You may use any results that are proved in the textbook, in lecture,
  or in tutorial. For example, you do not have to reprove Ford-Fulkerson's
  algorithm or closest pair of points algorithm if you use it to solve a
  question on the assignment.
  <li><i>Clarification:</i> For question 2, you must give a divide-and-conquer
  algorithm; any other type of algorithm will receive only part marks.
  (The whole point of the question is to make sure that you review and
  understand the closest-points algorithm presented in class.)
  <li>The marks allotment was not included on the assignment handout.
  It is 20-20-10-10 (for questions 1-4).
  <li>Sample solutions:
  <a href="hw3sol.pdf">PDF</a> or <a href="hw3sol.ps">PS</a>
</ul>


<h2><a name="hw2">Assignment 2</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="hw2.pdf">Assignment handout (PDF)</a>
  <a href="hw2.ps">(PS)</a>
  <li>Due at start of tutorial on Friday, February 17.
  <li>Now due by Monday, February 27 at noon. Assignments may be handed into
  the drop box near SB 1155 labelled "CSC373S" or given to the instructor.<br>
  If you hand in your assignment to the TA at the <i>start</i> of tutorial
  on February 17, you will receive extra credit.
  <li><i>Hint:</i> for Q2, you might find it useful to store more than one
  value at each location in the array.
</ul>


<h2><a name="hw1">Assignment 1</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="hw1.pdf">Assignment handout (PDF)</a>
  <a href="hw1.ps">(PS)</a>
  <li>Due at start of tutorial on Friday, January 27.
  <li><i>Clarification</i>: At the end of question 3, you are asked to
  "Prove that, for a
  given set of boxes with specified weights, the greedy algorithm ...".
  This means: "Prove that, for an arbitrary set of boxes with specified
  weights, the greedy algorithm ...".
  <li><i>Clarification:</i>: For question 4, once you have an algorithm,
  also give a short proof that your algorithm is correct.
  A full proof is not necessary for this question.
  You should also justify that your algorithm is efficient (i.e., polynomial).

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

<p>
Every assignment will consist of
a number of "pencil-and-paper" questions
(whose solution involves no programming and
can be handwritten or typed).
<!--, and
must be handed in using the
<a href="cover.pdf">cover sheet for assignments</a>
(Adobe PDF document).--></p>
<p>
All assignments must be submitted directly to the TA
at the <em>beginning</em> of tutorial on the due date.
Late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted
(including assignments submitted after the first 10 minutes of tutorial),
except in truly unusual circumstances.
<!--
(See the
<a href="../admin/index.shtml#dates">important dates</a>
for the exact due date of each assignment, and the
<a href="../admin/index.shtml#special">policy on special consideration</a>
for how to request an individual extension for unusual circumstances).
