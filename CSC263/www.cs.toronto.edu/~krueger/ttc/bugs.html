<H1>TTC Route Table Generator</H1>

<h3>Bugs listing</h3>

<p>I wrote this program one evening trying to figure out a
particularly difficult bus route. So there are bound to be many
bugs. Here are some known issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad TTC data -- I have yet to find a schedule that doesn't seem to 
have errors. The generator will try to make sense of them, but if
something looks fishy, double check the official TTC schedule.

<li>Real-time updating -- though the tables are generated directly 
from the tables on the TTC website, this webserver won't
allow me to download them on demand. (future feature for new server)

<li>Express busses --
they interfere with the algorithm to infer busses by changing the
ordering in the schedule. If one (express) branch passes another branch,
there might be a break in the table where the express bus jumps two
columns earlier. (will handle express busses separately in future)

<li>Short turns --
impossible to detect ahead of time, a short-turn bus might capture the
"end" of the next bus's route, if it's within 15 minutes. If there's
an unusual delay between stops, this might have happened. (future
work: detect and fix this by estimating interstop times)

<li>Last stop on route --
TTC doesn't list the times for the end of the route, so I can't
include them in the table. (future feature, estimate arrivial time
from opposite direction data)

<li>... probably other bugs too. Let me know about them!

Self notes:
<br>Good routes: 300, 100N, 51, 305, anything simple
<br>Minor problems: 34, 25S, 100S, 54, 320N, 512, 7, 6
<br>Horribly complex and broken routes: 35S
