</table>

<p>To pass the course you must receive at least 40% on the final exam.</p>


<p>
Late assignments will be handled based on a system of ``grace days'', as
follows: Each student begins the term with 3 grace days.  One grace day is
24 hours. If an assignment is due at 10:00 p.m. on a Thursday then an
assignment handed in by 10:00 p.m. on Friday uses one grace day; if handed
in by 10:00 p.m. Sunday, it uses up 3 grace days.  The grace days are
intended for use in emergencies (e.g., printer failure or car failure).  Do
not use them to buy an extension because of a busy week or you will be out
of luck in a true emergency. 
</p>
<!--<p><b> You may use at most one grace day for Assignment 4.</b></p>-->

<p>
If you are at risk of missing a deadline due to a busy week, rather than
use your grace days you should hand in a working (and tested) version of a
simpler program.  This will be easy to do if you have written and debugged
a series of programs that accomplish more and more of the assigned problem.
</p>

<p>
In the event of an illness or other catastrophe, get proper documentation
(e.g., medical certificate), and contact me (by phone, email or in person)
as soon as possible.  Do not wait until the due date has passed.  It is
always easier to make alternate arrangements before the due date or test day.
</p>

<p>
Since your assignments are submitted electronically and will usually be
tested using an automated testing program, you must follow the submission
instructions exactly.  If you do not, you will most likely lose substantial
marks on the assignment.  If you find you have submitted the wrong file or
omitted a file, please notify your instructor as soon as possible.
Please see the web page for full details.
</p>

<h3>Remarking</h3>

<p>Requests for remarking must be done using the provided online form
explaining in detail what your concern is.  Requests for remarking should be
submitted no later than one week after the assignment or test has been
returned to the class.

</p>
