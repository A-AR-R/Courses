<h3>Final exam information</h3>

<p>
The Faculty of Arts and Science has posted the <a href="http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/current/index.shtml">final exam schedule</a> (<a href="http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/current/exams/december.html">direct link</a>). It is also posted at the Computer Science Undergraduate Office. I'm not allowed to tell you when or where the exam is just in case I make a mistake, so you'll have to look it up yourself.

	<li>The final exam "cheat sheet":

	<a href="finalsheet.ps">PS</a>
	(you do not need to bring this to the exam,
	it will be provided for you attached to the exam)
	<li>Your own cheat sheet: you may also bring one letter-sized
	(8.5"x11") sheet of paper, handwritten (not photocopied) both sides,
	containing anything, to the exam.
	Use this to note concepts or usage that you may have trouble with.

<p>
Be aware:
The Faculty of Arts and Science has become very strict about unauthorized
aids at final exams.  This is a response to some innovative cheaters.
The consequences have been significant for students who have been caught
with unauthorized aids, whether or not they intended to use them to cheat.
</p>

<p>
The exam will potentially cover (obviously a three-hour exam can't be
comprehensive over this entire range of material):
</p>

<ul>
<li>software tools principles, stdin/stdout, inheritance of stdin/out, writing software tools and filters, command-line arguments
<li>shell programming: redirection, parentheses, pipes, variables, command-line substitutions, basic commands, control constructs
<li>the unix filesystem
<li>the C programming language (basic syntax, functions, extern, simple printf/scanf, pointers and arrays, simple C preprocessor, argv, strings, files, structs, separate compilation)
<li>processes, fork/exec/open/close/dup2, pipes
<li>C memory allocation, data types
<li>inter-process communication: sockets, TCP/IP, signals
<li>process states (ready to run, running, blocked) 
</ul>

<p>
Other matters which may have been mentioned in the course, but are excluded
from exam coverage:
</p>
<ul>
<li>details of C storage, OS interface, OS memory management, OS kernel
<li>creating libraries
<li>IP routing and TCP packet delivery, TCP connection initiation (handshaking)
<li>other TCP services
<li>system administration
<li>unix and internet security
<li>OS process management and context switching (multitasking implementation) 
<li>code for semaphores, threads, mutexes
<li>bit strings and direct manipulation
</ul>

<p>
BRING YOUR STUDENT PHOTO ID CARD. You will have to put it face up on your desk. 
</p>

<h3>Midterm information</h3>

<p>
The midterm will take place Tuesday, November 1 during regular class time in the regular room (BA 1180). The focus will be on the concepts covered so far in the course. Specific syntax details that can easily be looked up on a man page or errors that would be caught by the compiler will not be important, and such minor errors will not be penalized.
</p>

<p>
I will provide a "cheat sheet" that will list any C library function declarations you might need to use, switches for test, etc. This will resemble the cheat sheet provided in the Winter 2005 exam. Note that processes will not on the exam this term.
