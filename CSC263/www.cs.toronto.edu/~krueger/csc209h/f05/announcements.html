<b>Unofficial grades available</b><br>
I've posted the unofficial course grades to the online marks database.
I don't know when official grades will appear on ROSI, but hopefully
it won't be too long.</p>
<p>
I hope you enjoyed the course and learned a lot.
Thank you to everyone for all the effort you put into the course,
and I wish you all the best in your future!
</p>

<p>
<b>Final exam marks available</b><br>
I've finally been able to post the final exam marks.
If you want to know why you got the mark you did, look at the
sample solutions on the <a href="exams">Exams</a> page
(this should explain the marks for most students).
The class average on the final (not that it means much) was 70.<br>
A word of caution: computing the raw total is only an approximation of
your final grade, since it does not include any adjustments.
I'll let you know unofficially what your grade is once I have them.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 8 January 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>A4 marks available</b><br>
Assignment 4 marks are now available.
Your Marks.txt file has been added to your repository,
and the online marks database has been updated.
Some students have a TestReport.txt, some don't. Due to the nature of this
assignment, the autotesting didn't always work. Our testing was composed of
compiling your programs using a port we specified, testing your client with
our server, testing our client with your server, and the majority of the
testing involved your client with your server.
</p>
<p>
If there is a problem with any of your marks, you <b>must</b> let me know
immediately!
Final exam marks should also be posted soon. (edit: and A3 bonus marks
in the next update too)
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Friday, 30 December 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>A3 marks available</b><br>
Assignment 3 marks are now available.
Your Marks.txt and TestReport.txt files have been added to your repository,
and the online marks database has been updated.
If there is a problem with your marks, please let me know as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Assignment 4 and the final exam marks, and unofficial course grades
should be available the first weekend in January.
</p>

<h3>Wednesday, 21 December 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Happy Holidays</b><br>
Well, the term is finally over, so you can all take a well-deserved break.
The University is shut down now until January, and though we're madly
marking your final exams, final marks won't be available until then.
As soon as they're ready, I'll post the unofficial marks to the course website.
Official grades will be posted to ROSI sometime later in January.
In the meantime, please peruse the sample solutions to the final -- they're
posted on the <a href="exams">exams page</a>.
</p>
<p>
I hope everyone had fun in the course, and I wish everyone well as you move on
to greater things.
Now as an end-of-term treat, here's to carolling in the shell. :)

<p>
<b>Final review session</b><br>
I'll hold a final review session this Monday, December 19
from 5pm to 7pm in BA 3234. Bring your questions, from the course or
from old exams. I am planning to run it more as an office hour Q&amp;A,
but we could go through the course topics in an orderly fashion if
turnout is high.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 11 December 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Office hours this week</b><br>
I'll be changing some of the office hours due to it being exam week.
This week, my office hours are:<br>
Tuesday, 12-1pm in BA 3234 (changed time)<br>
Wednesday, 1-2pm in BA 3234 (normal time)<br>
or by appointment. Bring any questions related to the course, including
old exam questions.<br>
Next week I'll hold a review session on Monday (time and location to be announced).
</p>

<p>
<b>Office hours this week</b><br>
One of the TAs will be filling in for me in Wednesday's office hour.<br>

<b>Assignment 4 announcements</b><br>
Today I have a collection of assignment 4-related announcements.
<ul>
	<li>Sample executables are located in <tt>/u/csc209h/fall/pub/a4</tt>
	<li>Additional comments regarding which PORT to use have been
	added to the assignments page.
	<li>A sample chatserver might be running on werewolf.cdf.utoronto.ca
	at TCP port 22428 (that's "2-CHAT") for you to test with.
	Feel free to play with it, and let me know if it stops running.
	(Also, I am not chatting on it, so don't presume that any of the
	connected users are me. It's easy to fake a user name.)
</ul>
Finally, I've decided to simplify the assignment by removing the
<tt>ROSHAMBO</tt> and <tt>/play</tt> requirements. This will allow
you to concentrate on getting your client/server communication
working robustly.</p>
<p>
So, to restate, we will not be testing or evaluating your <tt>ROSHAMBO</tt>
or <tt>/play</tt> commands!
</p>

<b>Kill your left-over processes</b><br>
I was looking around the CDF servers, trying to find out why the load
averages were so high. I discovered hundreds of processes left behind
(some running, some blocked) named rps1 or rps2.<br>
If you left any rps processes behind when you logged off, please come
back and kill them, for the benefit of other users (and yourself).
Do a <tt>ps aux | grep yourlogin</tt> to get a listing of all processes
you own on the machine.

<h3>Wednesday, 30 November 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 marks available</b><br>
Your assignment 2 has been marked. Your Marks.txt and TestReport.txt files
have been added to your repository, and the online marks database has
been updated. If there's a problem with your marks, please let me know.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problems with email</b><br>
There was a serious problem with the email servers the past few days, and
messages may have been lost. The problem has been corrected, but if you
don't get a response from me, either post the question to the newsgroup or
resend it to me.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning regarding final exam aids</b><br>
I've been asked to pass along this warning:<br>
<i>The Faculty of Arts and Science has become very strict about unauthorized
aids at final exams.  This is a response to some innovative cheaters.
The consequences have been significant for students who have been caught
with unauthorized aids, whether or not they intended to use them to cheat.</i><br>
For example, simply having a calculator or cell phone on your desk may
cause you to have to explain yourself to the dean.
I have seen this happen in the past, and since the final exams are run by
the Faculty, instructors have no control over what happens. Be careful,
and listen to the instructions carefully! If in doubt, ask <i>before</i>
the exam begins.

<b>RPSpro Tournament to be held</b><br>
The tournament for part 3 is to be held at 12:30 this Thursday (right before class), in the
regular lecture room. If you still want to enter (for half bonus marks),
submit by 10pm Wednesday night. Your program must beat one of my programs
to qualify (and though my programs are really simple, I'm not saying how
they play).

final exam, so you do not need to bring it with you. You may also bring
your own "cheat sheet", but size is limited to one letter-sized
handwritten sheet (both sides).

<b>Grace days FAQ</b><br>
Q: Can I use grace days for assignment 3, now that it was extended?<br>
A: Yes. The grace days will still extend your hand-in date like normal.
</p><p>
Q: Do I get bonus marks if I have grace days left over at the end of the
course?<br>
A: No. Grace days are meant to be used if you have a last-minute emergency
that prevents you from finishing your assignment on time. If you don't
need to use your grace days, then good for you!
</p><p>
Q: Can I use multiple grace days for assignment 4?<br>
A: Yes. Thanks to the exam being late in the exam period, I don't need to
rush to get the assignment marked, so I can allow multiple grace days to
be used. Be sure to submit your grace days form <i>before</i> the due date,
as we'll start marking assignments as soon as possible (and if we mark your
assignment before you submit the form, we won't know you didn't finish it
yet).

<b>Assignment 3 extension granted</b><br>
Due to popular demand, but mostly due to lots of good questions and good
attendance in class today, I've agreed to extend the due date for
Assignment 3 by two days. Assignment 3 is now due <b>Saturday, November
19 at 10:00pm</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>First draft of Assignment 3 part 3 posted</b><br>
The first details for the <i>optional</i> part 3 component are now
posted on the assignments page. Additional details and hints will be
added in the coming days.

<p>
<b>Assignment 3 clarifications and hints</b><br>
EOF (end of file) is a state of a read file descriptor, not a string
being sent over the pipes. When you've opened a file descriptor for
reading, and you've already read everything in the file (where file may
mean pipe), the read functions (read, scanf, fgets, etc.) will return
something indicating that you've reached the end of the file.
To end a file coming from the keyboard, press Ctrl+D at the start of a
new line. To end a file that's actually a pipe, close all the write ends
of the pipe.
</p>
<p>
You will need a separate child process for each player instance in the
tournament. So, if you specify 5 competitors, you will have one roshambo
parent process and 5 children processes. You (the roshambo parent) will
need to interact with each of the children processes, so you will need
10 pipes to do it (5 pipes for parent writing to child, and 5 pipes for
child writing to parent).
</p>
<p>
Further hints are constantly being posted to the course newsgroup, so
make sure you take a look there if you encounter problems.
</p>

<h3>Tuesday, 8 November 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Assignment 3 sample programs</b><br>
I have posted an sample executable in the
<tt>/u/csc209h/fall/pub/a3</tt> directory on CDF.
The <tt>rps0</tt> program is a random player and prints lots of debugging
output to <tt>stderr</tt>, and might help testing your assignment.
A sample umpire program is named <tt>roshambo.sample</tt>
in the same directory.
<br>
To eliminate the debugging ouput from the
<tt>rps0</tt> program, redirect the <tt>stderr</tt> to <tt>/dev/null</tt>.
For example,<br>
<tt>$ ./roshambo.sample rps0 rps0 2> /dev/null</tt></p>
<p>
If you notice any bugs or poor error handling in the sample programs,
please let me know and I'll fix it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remember:</b> The programs you submit should <b>not</b> print the
debugging / diagnostic information to <tt>stderr</tt> like the sample
programs do. I've added these statements to the sample only to help you
get your programs working correctly!
</p>
<p>
<b>History's Worst Software Bugs</b><br>
Wired has a new article on
<a href="http://wired.com/news/technology/bugs/0,2924,69355,00.html">
History's Worst Software Bugs</a>.
Most of these bugs are problems we might encounter or discuss in this class.
Several of them are simply buffer overflows, which I'm sure everyone has
accidentally done at least once already.
Take comfort in that though buffer overflows might cost you some marks,
you probably won't end up killing anyone.

<p>
<b>Midterm marks</b><br>
The midterm has been marked, and marks posted online. The tests will be
returned this week. Due to the fire alarm at the start of the test,
and the added stress and shorter writing time resulting, I have adjusted
the marks by adding 4 points to everyone's score (the MTadj mark).
It was an unfortunate event, but I think this is the fairest way to deal
with it. If your resulting score is above 100%, enjoy your bonus!

<h3>Friday, 28 October 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Midterm test information</b><br>
The midterm will take place Tuesday, November 1 during regular class
time in the regular room (BA 1180). The focus will be on the concepts
covered so far in the course. Specific syntax details that can easily be
looked up on a man page or errors that would be caught by the
compiler will not be important, and such minor errors will not be
penalized.
</p>
<p>
I will provide a "cheat sheet" that will list any C library function
declarations you might need to use, switches for test, etc. This will
resemble the cheat sheet provided in the Winter 2005 exam. Note that
processes will not on the exam this term.
</p>

<h3>Tuesday, 25 October 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Extra pre-midterm office hours</b><br>
I've scheduled extra office hours for this Monday, October 31, from
2:30 to 4:30 in BA 3234. Bring questions from old terms, textbooks,
or topics that you're having trouble with. In lieu, my office hours on
November 1 and November 2 are cancelled, so I can get the exams marked as
quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>Assignment 1 marked</b><br>
Two files have been added to your assignment 1 CVS repository.
TestReport.txt contains our tests, the output of your scripts for each
of our tests, and the expected output, if your output differed.
Marks.txt contains a copy of the marking scheme, breakdown of your marks
on each point, and comments from the grader. The files we used for the
part 2 testing are available in the
<tt>/u/csc209h/fall/pub/tests/a1</tt> directory on CDF.
</p>
<p>
If you think an error has occurred in the marking of your assignment,
please fill out an online Remark Request form, which will be available
shortly in the forms section of the website.
</p>
<p>
The class average for the assignment was 20.3 out of 30.
Many people neglected to read the specs closely, and named their .macros
file incorrectly or stored it in the wrong location.
Be sure to read and follow the assignment specs carefully!

<b>newerthan clarifications</b><br>
Some clarifications have been added for newerthan. Only one of
<tt>-u</tt> or <tt>-c</tt> can be specified, and clarifies that only one
of the <tt>stat</tt> time fields should be checked (depending on options
specified). Also, if <tt>-a</tt> is not specified, don't print hidden
files.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 13 October 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>newerthan example correction</b><br>
There was an error in the example for newerthan. I included a directory
(specifically <tt>.</tt>) when the specification specifically asks for
only regular files. The example has been corrected to properly omit
directory names.
</p>
<p>
<b>CDF default dictionary fixed</b><br>
The CDF administrators have indeed fixed the default dictionaries.
You can now choose from Canadian, American and British English word lists
in the <tt>/usr/share/dict</tt> directory.

<b>Problem with CDF default dictionary</b><br>
An astute student noticed that <tt>/usr/share/dict/words</tt> wasn't
giving the results I expected. It turns out that the default
<tt>words</tt> dictionary is actually Catalan, not English.
CDF should have this problem corrected soon. The examples in the

<h3>Tuesday, 4 October 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Assignment 1 example error</b><br>
<p>An error in the part 1 example has been brought to my attention.
It should read:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
seawolf$ macro -l countusers
macro &quot;countusers&quot; is undefined
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <tt>-l</tt> was accidentally omitted.
The assignment spec has been corrected.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Friday, 30 Sept 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Another assignment correction</b><br>
There are actually <i>two</i> system include directories you should look
in: <tt>/usr/include</tt> and <tt>/usr/include/linux</tt>. If a relative
path is specified in a <tt>#include</tt> directive (for example,
<tt>#include &lt;sys/cdefs.h&gt;</tt>), you should search relative to
your search directories.
</p>
<p>
[Reasons for the second system include directory:
Most Unix-like systems behave in a very similar way, but run on
different kernels and hardware. We have a common set of library
functions to make systems look almost identical for programming, but the
details will vary. The generic header files are placed in the top level,
and system details are placed in separate directories, which are
included depending on which machine we're compiling on.
On CDF, we run Linux, hence we should also consider the
<tt>/usr/include/linux</tt> directory.
There are also additional directories for files required by different
compilers and different programming languages, but for simplicity, we'll
ignore these other directories for the assignment.]
</p>
<p>
Please also note that included files <i>do not</i> need to have a
<tt>.h</tt> extension. They may have any extension (commonly, we may
want to include <tt>.c</tt> files too) or even no extension at all
(most C++ headers omit the <tt>.h</tt> extension).
</p>
<p>
The assignment spec has been revised to reflect these clarifications.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Friday, 30 Sept 2005</h3>
<p>
<b>Typo in assignment example</b><br>
Due to the way HTML tags work and my poor job of proofreading,
an error crept into the assignment 1 specs with regard to the
<tt>helloworld.c</tt> example. I've corrected the HTML, now
properly encoding the &lt; and &gt; characters (thus not misleading your
browser into thinking this was some strange looking HTML tag).
</p>
<p>
The <tt>helloworld.c</tt> example should have read:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  printf("Hello world!\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
There was also a small (but obvious) error in the sample output
(I used a different filename to generate the example, but forgot to go
back and update the output).
</p>

<p>
My apologies for any confusion. The assignment specification has now
been corrected.

<b>General questions and the newsgroup</b><br>
Please try to post general questions to the course newsgroup,

<b>Running your scripts</b><br>

Are you having trouble running the script you wrote for assignment 1?
Check the following common problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the first line <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> ?
<li>Did you set the execute file permission (<tt>chmod +x myscript</tt>)?
<li>Is the current directory in your PATH, or are you specifying a
pathname to your script?
  <ul>
  <li>Run your script with a path, like <tt>./myscript</tt>, or
  <li>Add the current directory &quot;<tt>.</tt>&quot; to the end of your PATH
  by running<br>
  <tt>setenv PATH ${PATH}:.</tt><br>
  for tcsh (the default shell on CDF), or <br>
  <tt>export PATH=$PATH:.</tt><br>
  for bash. <b>Caution:</b> this is dangerous, for if you change into
  a hostile directory with executable files, you could unintentionally
  run a program that could take over your account!
  </ul>
</ul>

</pre>

<p>
If you are trying to connect to the repository from home, you will need
to set your <code>CVSROOT</code> to the following string.  
(Please note that it may be slightly different depending on the
application you are using.)
</p>

<pre>
:ext:yourid@cdf.utoronto.ca:/u/csc209h/fall/pub/repo/yourid
</pre>

<p>
You will also need to set <code>CVS_RSH</code> to <code>ssh</code> if
you are connecting from a remote machine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can check out the repository:
</p>

<pre>
cvs co assignments
</pre>

<p>
Now you will have a directory called <code>assignments</code> containg
5 directories: <code>CVS, a1, a2, a3, a4</code>.

You should do your work for assignment 1 in the <code>a1</code> directory, and
commit your work early and often to take advantage of the version control
features.

<b>Make sure you check out the repository and make sure you know how
to use it before the due date for assignment 1.</b>
