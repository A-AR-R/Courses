<b>Review session</b><br>
The regular Friday TA office hour this week, 4-6pm in BA 3234,
will be run as a review session.
The focus will be primarily the computability part of the course,
and may work through the computability questions on past exams
(somewhat like the tutorials covered wrt complexity this week).
Bring your questions, either things you were unclear about, had trouble with,
or even questions you found interesting from past exams.
</p>
<p><b>Old final exams and exam tips posted</b><br>
Some additional past final exams are posted on the <a href="tests">Tests</a>

<b>A3 solutions posted</b><br>
Sample solutions for assignment 3 are posted on the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
These are not the only ways to solve the problems,
and there might be easier ways to do it.
You should be able to understand why these solutions solve
the problems, though (and that might help you on the test).

<h3>Monday, 24 July 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A3 submissions</b><br>
Several students have asked about sending me an electronic version of
their assignments to save coming all the way in to campus to put it in
the drop box. Short answer: yes!
</p>
<p>
Long answer: that is definitely acceptable as long as: 1) it arrives in
my emailbox by the due time, 2) it's in a format I can easily print
and give to the TA for marking (PDF or PS is preferable, as it should
preserve all your formatting; .doc or text files are acceptable too, but
be aware that I probably don't have the right fonts for your MS Word file
and it might end up having unreadable symbols),
and 3) it's readable by the TA when I print it
(so if you scan it in, make sure it's dark enough).

Due to popular demand (and as announced in tutorial last night),
I'm extending the due date for A3 until Monday, July 24 at 7:00pm.

the test on Tuesday.

The first term test, covering anything from the start of the course through
to the end of last tutorial, will be held tomorrow at 6:10pm - 7:00pm.
Following the test will be regular class, delving into more details and
examples of mapping reducibility. A good source for practice (or what types
of questions to expect on the test), take a look at past term's tests.
</p>
<p><b>Online marks posting</b><br>
Your A1 marks have been added to the <a href="marks">online marks</a> posting.
Please verify your grade has been recorded correctly, and let me know if
there are any problems. You should also change your password immediately
to protect the secrecy of your grades from anyone else who might know your
student number.

<b>Extra time to hand in assignment</b><br>
As mentioned in class, we won't collect your assignment 1 from the drop box
until after 7:00 tonight. This should allow those working during the day
time to drop off their assignments.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 5 June 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Assignment hints and clarifications</b><br>
The majority of general questions regarding the assignment are being
answered (and asked) in the course newsgroup.
You may want to read this newsgroup regularly.
The CDF web page has hints on getting set up and reading news groups,
but may also be able to use services such as Google Groups.
</p>

<h3>Friday, 2 June 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>TA office hour</b><br>
A TA will be available to answer any of your course related questions
on Mondays, 5-7pm in room SF4301. (At times, the TA might move to another
room, and a note on the door of SF4301 will direct you to the new location.)
</p>

<p>
<b>A1 typo corrected</b><br>
Question 3 should have said "... some string of length <i>k</i>."
(The first occurrence of the word "length" was a typo.)
It has been corrected in the online handout.
</p>

<h3>Tuesday, 30 May 2006</h3>

<b>A1 posted</b><br>

<p>
<b>Tutorial week 2 exercise updated</b><br>
I have inserted the actual textbook question in the tutorial exercise for
this week on the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page, since the textbook
hadn't yet arrived in the bookstore.
The TA will go through the exercises at a slower pace until the textbook
arrives.
</p>
<p><b>Finding the textbook...</b><br>
I just heard from the U of T Bookstore that they don't expect the course
textbook to arrive until Friday. The Discount Textbooks bookstore across
the street (on College Street, behind Einstein's) does have the book in
stock for about $94... much cheaper than Amazon.ca's $120 (and the
bookstore).
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 17 May 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Office hours</b><br>
I will hold office hours Wednesdays 4-5 in BA 3234. If you need to see me
and can't make this time, please email me for an appointment.
