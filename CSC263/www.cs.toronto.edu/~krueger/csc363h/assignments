<h2><a name="a4">Assignment 4</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="a4/handout.pdf">Assignment handout (PDF)</a>
  <a href="a4/handout.ps">(PS)</a>
  <li>Due by 7:00pm inside drop box in BA 2220 on Thursday, August 10.<br>
  <li>Some people asked about the game of Amazons. Here are some pictures
  I stole from the Internet showing the initial state of the 10x10 game,
  a middle game state (illustrating a move), and an end game position
  (all the amazons are separated, assuming good play,
  so we can determine who will win).<br>

  <li>Q1: Do not try to solve TSP in polynomial time (you proved that TSP
  is NP-complete on Test 2, so it's unlikely you'll be able to do it).
  Just show that TSP is polytime self-reducible.

  <li>Due by 7:00pm inside drop box in BA 2220 on Thursday, June 8.
  <li>For question 2, a picture of the initial configuration of
  a multitrack Turing machine (on input <tt>abc</tt>) might look
  something like the following:
<pre>
+-----+
|     |
| q_0 |------+
|     |      |
+-----+      |
             V
           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+--
           | a | b | c |   |   |   |   | ...
           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+--
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | ...
           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+--
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | ...
           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+--

</pre>
  <p>
  I have drawn seven "cells" from left to right, and there are three tracks
  in this example.
  Remember that the single read/write head reads and writes all tracks
  (all three tracks in this example) at once for a particular cell.

  <li><a href="a1/a1.marking.notes.txt">Marking notes from the TA</a> - 
  the TA makes several important points about common errors students were
  making. Please read his notes, even if you aced the assignment, to see
  where students typically go wrong and why it's wrong.

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

<p>
Every assignment will consist of
a number of "pencil-and-paper" questions
(whose solution involves no computer programming and
can be handwritten or typed).
<!--, and
must be handed in using the
<a href="cover.pdf">cover sheet for assignments</a>
(Adobe PDF document).-->
Please recall that the 20% rule does not apply to assignments,
where you have the time (and the responsibility) to ask questions
and learn how to solve each problem.
</p>
<p>
All assignments must be submitted
directly to the CSC 363 drop box in BA 2220
or given directly to the instructor
before the specified time on the due date.
Late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted
<!--(including assignments submitted after the first 10 minutes of tutorial),-->
except in truly unusual circumstances.
<!--
(See the
<a href="../admin/index.shtml#dates">important dates</a>
for the exact due date of each assignment, and the
<a href="../admin/index.shtml#special">policy on special consideration</a>
for how to request an individual extension for unusual circumstances).
