<h2>General information</h2>

<p>
Check the <a href="#pastofferings">past course offerings</a>
section for links to previous offerings of this course,
where you can find term tests and assignments to practice on.
</p>

<p>
The term tests will last <em>50 minutes</em>
and will be held during regularly scheduled lecture and/or tutorial time.
</p>

<p>
If you have any serious conflict
with the time or date of the test(s),
please inform your instructor <em>immediately</em>
to make alternative arrangements.
</p>

<p>
The tests will be <em>closed book</em>
(<em>i.e.</em>, NO aids allowed),
and should be written in <em>pen</em>
(remarking requests for tests written in pencil will not be accepted)
&mdash; the test paper will have lots of room for rough work.
</p>

<h3>The "20% rule"</h3>

<p>
We want to encourage you to be aware of (and honest about)
what you know and what you do not know,
because it's important to be aware of the level of your own knowledge.
(Also, to be quite frank,
this will spare you the trouble of writing
&mdash; and us the trouble of reading &mdash;
lots of random or irrelevant bits of information
in the hopes of getting a few part marks.)
For this reason,
if you cannot answer a question
(or part of a question)
on a term test or on the final exam,
you will receive 20% of the marks for that question
(or part of a question) if you write
</p>
<blockquote><p>
      <em>I don't know.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(or something similar)
in the space reserved for your answer.
<em>You will NOT receive the 20%
if you leave your answer completely blank,
or if you write anything in addition to the sentence above</em>,
because neither of those cases
show that you are aware of what you don't know.
However, if you cross off an answer that you realized was wrong
(so it will not be marked),
and then write the sentence above,
you will receive the 20%.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is certainly possible to get less than 20% on a question,
if you write an answer that is mostly incorrect.
Note also that this rule <em>does not apply on assignments</em>,
where you have the time (and the responsibility)
to ask questions and learn how to solve each problem.
</p>

<h2><a name="test1">Test 1 Details</a></h2>

<p>
Term Test 1 will be written at the start of lecture time and
last about 50 minutes (6:10-7:00). Two hours of lecture time will
follow the exam (there will be no tutorial).
</p>
<p>
The test will cover everything up to reducibility (including tutorial
coverage). The test will be similar to the tests from past terms,
so they (and the assignments) will be a good source of study material.

<h2><a name="test2">Test 2 Details</a></h2>

<p>
Term Test 2 will be written at the start of lecture time and
last about 50 minutes (6:10-7:00). 
This will be followed by a 10-15 minute break, 
followed by two hours of lecture time
(there will be no tutorial this week).
</p>
<p>
The test will cover everything since the start of complexity
(weeks 7 through 10), including tutorial coverage
-- there will be no computability on the test!
The test will be similar to the tests from past terms,
so they (and the assignments) will be a good source of study material.
</p>
<p>
The test will consist of 2-3 questions, and will include at least one
NP-completeness proof. Make sure you prove/justify all your statements
(i.e., your verifier is polytime, your reduction is polytime,
the iff of your reduction, etc.).

<h2><a name="final">Final Examination Details</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="finalpaper.ps">Exam paper as written (Summer 2006)</a>
</p>
<p>
The final exam will be written at the time set by the
<a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/undergraduate/exams/august-2006-exam-schedule">Final Exam Timetable</a>, which is now available.
Make sure you note the date, time and room carefully.
Follow the instructions provided by the faculty if you
have a conflict for the final exam.
</p>

<p>
The exam is set for <i>three hours</i> in length.
The exam is <i>closed-book</i> but a <i>handwritten</i> notes-sheet is
permitted as your only aid.
It must be a US letter-sized sheet of paper (8.5" by 11") and must contain
only hand-written notes on both sides.
You must make your notes-sheet available to the exam presiding officers
for inspection at any time.
Make sure you have only handwritten notes on the sheet: otherwise it will
be confiscated and you may face penalties and sanctions as specified by the
Registrar's Office (I have no control over that).
</p>

<!--
<p>
The final exam will consist of 5-6 questions.
Each will consist of a problem (or series of related problems) for which
you will give an efficient algorithm to solve or approximate,
prove that an algorithm solves or approximates the problem, or both.
</p>

<p>
The exam will cover the following topics: greedy algorithms and their proofs,
dynamic programming algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms,
expressing problems using network flow, expressing problems as linear programs,
and approximation algorithms.
</p>
-->

<p>
The textbook exercises and past exams are good sources of study questions.
In the back of each chapter there are solved exercises you can try and check,
and many other problems you can try solving.
The Past Course Offerings section contains links to some of these exams.
The Faculty of Arts and Science on St. George campus also has a website
containing many of the past final exams for their courses.
<a href="http://eres.library.utoronto.ca/">UofT Library Past Exams website</a>.
In addition to past exams for CSC 363 (and CSC 365, the enriched version
of this course), about half the material on past CSC 364 exams is similar
to material on our exam (CSC 364 used to be 363+373).

<H3>Warning</H3>

<p>
I've been asked to pass on the following warning, in that no one
inadvertently violates the (unfortunately necessarily) strict rules:
</p>

<blockquote>
The Faculty of Arts and Science has become very strict about unauthorized
aids at final exams.  This is a response to some innovative cheaters.
The consequences have been significant: students don't only lose the
aid, but they may lose the exam.  This is the case whether or not they
intended to use the unauthorized aid to cheat.
<p>
There have been a lot of cases recently with cell phones, pagers and
unauthorized calculators.  Cell phones and pagers are not allowed,
even if they will be used just to tell the time.                          
<p>
There was a case last year involving two friends who were communicating.
They may just been rolling their eyes as if to say "this test is
stupid/annoying, ha ha", but there was obviously communication going on
and they got charged.  Unfortunately it's completely untenable to have a
rule which says that communication is allowed iff it's not on the topic of
the exam.  So people who can't help communicating should take care not to
sit near each other.
</blockquote>

<p>
Even bringing in a photocopied aid sheet would be a violation, which
would be treated very strictly by the Faculty--don't do it!
</p>

<h3>Final Exam Tips</h3>

<p>
Many of the following hints were written by a previous instructor,
but are so valuable I'm copying them for you.
</p>

<p>
<i>Studying for the exam</i><br>

For the final exam, you will be allowed to bring ONE 8.5" x 11" sheet of
paper, HANDwritten on both sides, and nothing else (no calculator or other
electronic device -- be aware that the Chief Presiding Officers appointed
by the Faculty of Arts and Science have recently been more strict about
taking away cellphones, pagers, and other unauthorized electronic devices).
<p>
For your aid sheet, I recommend that you start by writing down the main
topics and subtopics of the course, and review all of the lecture and
tutorial notes; make sure that you understand everything in the notes,
including all of the proofs, and ask questions if you don't.
<p>
You should also read all of the relevant chapters in the textbook, but you
can safely ignore any sections that cover material that was never
mentioned in lectures, tutorials, assignments, or term tests.
<p>
Make sure you go over ALL of the assignment solutions and that you
understand them.  Make sure that you also understand the mistakes you may
have made, why they were mistakes, and what the correct answers were.
That's the whole point of learning: to make mistakes and understand the
difference between what's correct and what isn't so that you don't repeat
your mistakes!
<p>
Also, by reading the posted solutions carefully, you may notice things you
hadn't thought of when you were working on the problems, and maybe learn a
few new techniques or tricks for solving certain types of problems.
<p>
Do the same for the term tests.
<p>
As you're going over all of this course material, keep notes on the
important points, on details you know you have trouble remembering, etc.:
this is exactly the stuff that you should put down on your aid sheet.
<p>
Once your aid sheet is ready, the best way to get ready is practice,
practice, practice!  Go over as many exercises and problems from the
textbook as you can, and the same for previous year's assignments, tests,
and exams (which you can get from the CSSU or the UofT Library website --
there's a link above).
<p>

<i>Writing the exam</i><br>

READ THE QUESTIONS!  If you answer the wrong question, even if it's because
you were nervous and you misread it, there is nothing that we can do.  If
something is unclear, don't be afraid to ask.
<p>
SHOW WHAT YOU KNOW!  Your strategy during the exam should be:
<ul>
<li>  identify the questions that you know how to answer (this means that you
    must read EVERY question before you start answering any of them);
<li>  answer those questions right away;
<li>  go back to the questions you're not sure about, and work on them;
<li>  if you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one and come back
    later (don't waste your time) -- you can figure out ahead of time how
    much time to devote to each question (based on how much it's worth),
    and stick to that estimate as much as possible.
</ul>
<p>
If you have an idea how to solve a question but no time to do it in detail,
then of course you should write down your idea.  Also, for most questions,
you will get roughly half of the marks for having the correct structure
(i.e., clearly showing that you know what you are supposed to do), even if
you cannot fill in the details.
<p>
EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE DOING!  When you give an answer, make sure that you
give at least a short statement of what you're doing before giving us the
answer: if your answer is incorrect, this can make the difference between
getting NO mark (because we can't tell if you understand what you're doing)
or getting part marks (if we see that you have the right idea but simply
made a small error, or that you have the wrong idea but wrote it up
correctly).
<p>
DON'T RAMBLE!  Write concise, to-the-point answers.  If you ramble, the
feeling it gives us is that you don't know the correct answer.  Also, be
aware that if you give us a correct answer followed by explanations that
are clearly wrong or irrelevant, you will lose marks!  So only write down
what you know is correct: if you're not sure, either say so explicitly or
don't say anything.
<p>
On the other hand, if you start writing down an answer and you realize that
it's wrong, SAY SO!  You'll get more part marks for showing that you
understand your mistake, even if you're not sure how to fix it, than if you
simply leave it like that (which gives the impression that you don't even
realize that what you did was wrong).
<p>
On a related note, don't feel like you must fill all of the available
space: it is quite possible that a correct answer will require only part of
the space for some questions.
<p>
RELAX!  You'll function much better if you are well-rested and relaxed than
if you are tired or tense.  If you know that you are the type of person who
gets extremely nervous during a final exam, then take the time to talk to
other people to find out what they do to relax, or go to the Learning
Skills Centre in the Koffler building and talk to the people there.  They
have experience helping people cope with "exam anxiety" to allow you to
really show what you know.
