<b>Unofficial grades posted</b><br>
The final exam marks and unofficial course grades are now posted
on the <a href="marks">Marks</a> page. Remember, grades are not final
until approved and posted to ROSI, but they shouldn't be too different
from what I posted here.<br>
I hope you had a good term, and have a great summer!

<b>Comments from the marker regarding w3</b><br>
I have posted to the <a href="assignments#a3">Assignments</a> page
some comments made by the marker regarding the
written portion of A3.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marks posted for programming portion of A3</b><br>
As the title says. The tester we used has also been posted to the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
Note that the written portion was generally poorly
done, which is why the class average for A3 is around 50%.
I'm sure this blip will be corrected in the remaining term work
and the final exam, so I'm not too concerned (as long as everyone
works on learning how to compute expectations!).
</p>
<p>
<i>Are you concerned about a poor mark on A3?</i>
Read the sample solutions, and reread your notes and the text.
Come ask me questions with things you don't understand.
In general, I'm more interested in you learning the covered material
by the end of the course, than whether you had a hard time with one
assignment.
So if you show me on the final exam that you've learned the course material
well, I'll give you credit for that when computing your final grade.
(I'm not allowed to throw the mark away, but I can be convinced that it
might not be an accurate representation of your knowledge, and make 
suitable adjustments to your grade.
If you work hard you can still get a good course grade.)<br>
Remember that if you're ever concerned about how well you're doing
in a class (mine or another class), use my office hours to get extra help
-- I want you to succeed! I guarantee an extra grade point if you visit
regularly and put in effort! (* offer not valid for A+ students)

<b>Error in MT solution for Q1c</b><br>
One of your classmates noticed that my sample solution for Q1c
on the midterm is incorrect. However, the midterms were marked correctly.
The sample solution has now been corrected.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 18 March 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Marks posted for MT, w3</b><br>
The <a href="marks">Online Marks posting</a> has been updated with
the midterm marks and marks for the written portion of A3.
Many students had a lot of difficulty with expectations--if
that includes you, you should consider working through some old
exam problems and/or come see me.<br>
Be sure also to read and <i>understand</i> the sample solutions
I have posted, and come see me if you have any trouble
understanding them.
</p>

<b>BFS computes shortest paths proof</b><br>
A sketch of the proof for today's theorem that BFS computes 
the shortest paths from s has been posted to the
<a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page, under notes for this week.
I think it's a little easier to read than the CLRS version.

<b>A1 written component marks posted</b><br>

the marks for the written portion of assignment 1 have been added.
To access your marks, log in with your student number -- the password
is initialized to be your student number, though you should change it
when you first log in (to maintain privacy in case someone knows
your student number).<br>
The marks for the written and programming components will eventually be
combined, and the TOTAL field is a running total of the marks you have
earned towards your final grade.<br>
Your written assignemnts will be returned in class this week, while
the programming components will probably be returned to you electronically.

<b>Feb 7 Day of Action for public post-secondary education</b><br>
If you're planning to attend the rally in downtown Toronto on Wednesday,
know that the UofT administration is asking faculty to
accommodate students unable to meet their academic obligations on Feb
7 as a result of their participation in the Day of Action.
We don't have a test or homework scheduled in our class, so just be sure
to get the notes if you're away participating in this demonstration.

<p>
<b>CS Games contest</b><br>
I just received info about an interesting computer competition
happening in Montreal in March 9-11. The CS Games combines theory,
programming and gaming into a school-vs.-school contest.
It looks like U of T hasn't been one of the 24 schools that participated
before, so get 7-10 students together and 
this might be your chance to make history.

<b>Notes posted; downtown colloquium announcement</b><br>
Notes for the first couple weeks of class are now posted on the
<a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
These are supplementary/complementary to the lectures and don't replace
attendence in class. Use them in case you missed some details in lecture,
and use them to guide your textbook reading (for all the details).
</p>
<p>
Also, tomorrow there is a Distinguished Lecture Series Colloquium downtown
that might be interesting. It's by Claire Kenyon-Mathieu and entitled
<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/reg/list_full.pl?20070016-1100.26463">How to rank with few errors</a>.
She will consider the problem of how to rank players in a tournament
fairly when the answer is not obvious (i.e., when A beat B beat C beat A).
It will give you a look at current research problems and directions in the
area of computer science we're studying in this course.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 10 January 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Lecture room change</b><br>
Staring Monday, January 15, lectures will now be held in room BV355.
This should be a better sized room for us. Tutorials remain unchanged.
I'll see you in our new room Monday.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 7 January 2007</h3>
<p>
<b>Tutorials start this week</b><br>
There will be a tutorial held this Monday, January 8.
It will be a review of proving worst-case running time and
asymptotic notation, slanted to getting you in practice for
solving the types of problems you'll see in this course.
</p>
