<h2><a href="..">CSC B63</a>: Course Policies</h2>


<h3><a name="waivers">Prerequisites and Waivers</a></h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/calendar/Computer_Science.html#CSCB63H3">stated prerequisites</a> in this course are:<br>
Prerequisite: <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/calendar/Computer_Science.html#CSCB07H3">CSCB07H</a>  &amp; <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/calendar/Computer_Science.html#CSCB36H3">CSCB36H</a>  &amp; <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/calendar/Statistics.html#STAB52H3">STAB52H</a>  &amp; [CGPA 2.5 or enrolment in a CSC subject POSt]
</p>

<p>
<i>The prerequisite requirement is strictly enforced in this course.
  If you do not satisfy it, you must contact the instructor and submit
  a petition for a waiver within the first week of class.</i>
Your petition should include the following information:
your full name and student number, the specific prerequisite that you
are requesting a waiver for, the reason for the request, and
supporting documentation showing that you know the material covered
by the prerequisite that you would like to be waived.
This should include a recent printout of your academic transcript
(your academic history printed from ROSI is sufficient).
</p>

<h4>Requesting waivers</h4>
<p>
The university deadline for requesting a waiver (for unsatisfied
course prerequisites or CGPA requirements) is TBA.
How to request a waiver depends on which prerequesite you require waived:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CSCB07H: contact the instructor. A waiver will often be granted
  if you have programming experience or if you're taking CSCB07 concurrently.
  <li>CSCB36H: contact the instructor.
  As the material in this course builds on the concepts covered by this
  prerequisite, students without this prerequisite seldom pass CSCB63,
  thus waivers will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.
  <li>STAB52H/STA247H1/STA255H1/STA257H1: contact the instructor. Knowledge of
  statistics and probability theory is crucial to approximately 20-25%
  of this course. Without the background provided by this course, students
  are unlikely to succeed in CSCB63, thus waivers will only be granted in
  exceptional circumstances.
  <li>CGPA 2.5/enrolment in a CSC subject POSt: <!--you must contact the
  Department of Computer Science Undergraduate Office to obtain a waiver.-->
  contact the instructor. You will need permission of the department
  to take the class.
</ul>

<h3>Course evaluation</h3>
<p>
There will be four homeworks, a midterm test and a final exam,
as detailed on the course information sheet.
</p>
<p>
Important note: A mark of at least 40% on the final exam is necessary to pass the course.  Repeated differently:  If you receive less than 40% on the final exam you automatically fail the course, regardless of how well you have done on homeworks or the midterm test.
</p>

Textbook readings will be assigned prior to each class, and should be
completed before lecture.

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>
Each homework assignment will consist of a written
"pencil-and-paper" component
(whose solution involves no programming and can be handwritten or typed)
and a programming component
(whose solution will involve some amount of programming).
</p>
<ul>
<li>The written component is due at the <i>beginning of class</i>
on the date specified and must be handed in with the cover sheet.
The written portion should be submitted directly to the instructor; to
prevent disruption, assignments will not be accepted after the first 5
minutes of class. A drop box is also available in BA 2220 if you wish to
hand in your assignment early (due to class absence), but it must be
deposited in the drop box at least 30 minutes prior to class
on the due date.
<li>The programming portion must be submitted electronically: paper
printouts will not be accepted. Electronic submission details will be
provided with the assignment description.
</ul>

<!--
<h3>Homework collaboration policy and Group work</h3>
<p>
In each homework you may collaborate with at most one other student
who is currently taking CSCB63H3Y. If you choose to work with another
student on a homework, you and your partner must submit only
<i>one copy</i> of your solution (write both your names on the cover
sheet of the written component and also include both names in the
header of your program files you submit).
The solution will be graded in the same way whether it was completed
alone or with a partner.
Collaboration involving groups of more than two students is
<i>not</i> allowed.
</p>

<p>
It is critically important that both group members understand every
problem. A divide-and-conquer approach is a poor idea as it will
leave members at a distinct disadvantage in learning the material and
passing the exams. Instead, plan to work out the problems together,
discussing it until you agree on a solution.
</p>
-->

<h4>Consultation</h4>
<p>
For help with your homework you may consult <i>only</i> the
instructor, TAs, <!--your homework partner (if you have one),--> your
textbook and your class notes. <i>You may not consult any other source!</i>
In particular, you may not use the Internet to research the
problems.

<h3>Late work policy: lateness, absence and extensions</h3>
<p>
Late assignments will not be accepted. In the case of a
missed test, a mark of zero will be recorded: no make-up
test will be provided. Only in exceptional circumstances will
requests for extensions for assignment deadlines or excuses for missed
tests be entertained. Any request for special consideration must be
presented to the course instructor (not a TA) with all supporting
documentation as soon as possible. For medical excuses, only the
official UofT medical certificate will be accepted.
</p>
<p>See <a href="special.html">Policy on special consideration</a>.
</p>

<h3>Remarking</h3>
<p>
Any dispute over the grading of an assignment or test should be
stated in writing (using the form on the website) and
submitted along with the original copy of your work.
Remarking requests may be submitted directly to the instructor
or to the course drop box in BA 2220 along with an email to the instructor
informing him of its presence in the drop box.
See <a href="remarking.html">Policy on remarking requests</a>.
</p>

<h3>Plagiarism and Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
<i>The work you submit must be your own and cannot contain anyone
  else's work or ideas, without proper attribution.</i>
Plagiarism is a form of academic fraud and is treated very seriously.
Plagiarism isn't just copying large chunks of text, it's using
someone else's words, code or ideas in something you submit for credit.
Words, code and ideas can be transmitted either by actually sharing
files or simply by talking too much.
Avoid seeing each other's work or talking about it in any detail!
</p>
<p>
Note that it is a serious offense to help someone commit plagiarism.
<i>Do not let others look at your solutions, even in draft form.</i>
If you are unsure whether an activity may constitute plagiarism or
undue collaboration, consult the instructor immediately.
