<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>
General techniques for efficient algorithm design: greedy
algorithms, dynamic programming; other topics may include network flow,
linear programming, randomized algorithms. Introduction to
complexity theory: models of computation, the classes P and NP,
polynomial time reducibility and NP-completeness, provably hard problems.
Introduction to the theory of computability: Church's thesis, computable
and noncomputable functions, reductions, the analogies
between complexity and computability theory.<br>
Prerequisite: CSC238H1/(MAT246Y1/247H1, plus some
knowledge of programming); CGPA 3.0/enrolment in a CSC subject POSt
</p>


<h2>Course Organization</h2>

<p>
More information relevant to this incarnation of the course is available
in the <a href="Outline.ps">course outline</a>.
There are main three topics to this course.
<ul>
<li><i>Computability Theory</i> -- What is a computer? How do we model
computation? What are things we can and cannot compute?
<li><i>Efficient Algorithm Design</i> -- What techniques can we use to
solve problems efficiently? When do they work? When do they not work?
<li><i>Complexity Theory</i> -- What are complexity classes? How do we
show problems are easier or harder than other problems?
</ul>
This is basically the order in which the topics will be covered.
Each section will roughly compose a third of the course, each taking
about 4 weeks to cover.
</p>
<p>
<i>Homework:</i>
Each week a number of problems will be assigned relating to the course
material. You will be expected to complete some of the problems to be
handed in and graded. These problems will compose three assignments
throughout the term.
Some problems will be assigned yet not form part of the assignments.
You are encouraged to work on these problems and solve them, as they
will further your understanding of the material (and may appear on
quizzes!).
</p>
<p>
<i>Quizzes:</i>
Occasionally quizzes will be held in the tutorial session. 
One (or a few) of these weekly assigned problems, or a closely related
problem, will be asked. The quizzes will be closed book and presume you
know how to solve the assigned problems.
</p>
<p>
<i>Grading:</i>
Most of the problems in this course will involve proofs or
counterexamples. Answers must be concise, clear, well thought out and
presented neatly to obtain full marks. Up to 25% will be deducted for
overly long, rambling, sloppy or unclear answers, at the grader's
discretion.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fifth Rule:</i>
In mathematics it is important to know both how to solve problems and
when one does not know how to solve a given problem. Hence incorrect
answers may be given zero credit, whereas if you recognize that you
cannot solve a problem and state only this, you will be given one fifth (20%)
credit on the problem. In other words, a wrong answer will earn zero
marks, but an answer of "I don't know the answer" will earn 1/5 marks.
</p>
<p>
<i>Policy on Lateness, Absence and Extensions:</i>
Late assignments will generally not be accepted.
In the case of a missed quiz or test, a mark of zero will be recorded.
No make-up quiz or test will be provided.
Only in exceptional circumstances will requests for extensions for
assignment deadlines or excuses for missed tests be entertained.
Any such request must be presented to the course instructor (not a TA)
with all supporting documentation as soon as possible. 
The sole remedy available in exceptional circumstances for missed tests
is redistribution of its weight to other components.

-->

<p><b>Required:</b>
Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/">
Introduction to Algorithms</a> (2nd edition)<br>
This text (CLRS) is also used in CSC378.
The most relevant chapters are 3,15,16,25,26,34.
It does not cover all the complexity and computability material we require.
Regardless, any computer scientist should have a good book on algorithms.
It should serve as a valuable reference throughout your career.
</p>

<p><b>Recommended:</b>
M. Sipser. <u>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</u><br>
The most relevant chapters are 0,3,4,5,7,8.
This text (Sipser) covers only computability and complexity.
</p>

<p><b>Optional:</b>
Garey and Johnson. <u>Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory
of NP-Completeness</u><br>
The introductory chapters 1,2,3 are especially relevant.
This is a classic book, deserving a spot on any bookshelf.
</p>

<p>
There are several
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hsc/364/notes/">notes</a>
composed by previous instructors of this course.
They will serve as a valuable, concise reference.
They will be updated during the term as we cover the material, so only
print out the current pieces.

<h2>Policy on Collaboration</h2>

<p>
You are expected to work on each problem on your own and present your
own solution. You may use the textbooks, notes, lectures, instructors,
tutors and classmates to help you find general strategies to solve the
problems, but you may not go out and find complete solutions to the
problems.
You may discuss the strategies to solve these problems with your fellow
students, but you may not discuss complete solutions.
You cannot take written notes or solutions away from a discussion with
another student.
Using other people's work or solutions, whether cited or not, is
considered plagiarism and carries stiff academic penalties.
If you are unsure whether an activity may constitute plagiarism or
undue collaboration, consult the instructor immediately.
You are encouraged to review the University of Toronto
<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/govcncl/pap/policies/behaveac.html">
Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another instructor explains Academic Honesty very well
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hsc/364/honesty.html">here</a>.
I encourage you to read it.
</p>


<h2><A NAME="hw">Assigned Questions</A></h2>

<p>
Assignments are due by 6pm on the Thursday due date in the CSC 364

the due date.
Late assignments will not be accepted in the drop box.
</p><p>
Every assignment must include <a href="hw/coverk.ps">this cover page
(PS)</a> (<a href="hw/coverk.pdf">PDF</a>)

sign this page before submitting.
Assignments should be stapled securely: do not submit within an envelope,
binder or folder, or bound with paper-clips, string, or any origami
technique.
Remember you should only hand in the questions indicated by a star *.

The deadline for remarking is two weeks following the return of the
marked paper. Note that a remark may result in changes to marks assigned
on other questions, and could possibly lower your total mark.
If the remarking is not satisfactory, it must be presented
in entirety to the instructor within one week of the date of the remark.
All mark appeals on term work and tests must be submitted before the
final exam is held.
