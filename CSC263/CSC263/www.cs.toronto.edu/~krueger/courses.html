<h2>Courses at Toronto</h2>

<p>
This is a link (for my use) of courses I've taken (in some form or
another) while staying at the University of Toronto. A list of
University of Alberta courses might be <a
href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~richard/courses.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
These are my courses from the spring term 2002.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~karan/courses/csc418/winter_2002/index.
html">
CSC 418/2504 - Computer Graphics</a><br>
I want to learn how to draw pictures on my computer.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bonner/courses/2002s/csc2509/">
CSC 2509 - Data Management Systems</a><br>
I was assured this course would be in more detail than my undergrad
courses... so far, it's on par with my second year database course!
Alas, it's too late to switch into something less trivial and more
interesting. :(
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fich/2414/">
CSC 2414 - Topics in Applied Discrete Mathematics: Analysis of Algorithms</a><br
>
Recreational summations in the style of Donald Knuth.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc2429h/">
CSC 2429 - Topics in Complexity Theory: Proof Complexity and Bounded Arithmetic</a><br>
Proof systems according to Stephen Cook.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~molloy/2410/index.html">
CSC 2410 - Algorithms in Graph Theory</a><br>
Nearly forgot this one. Learning Mike Molloy's version of graph theory.
<p>
<li>FSL 102 - Introductory French II<br>
Fulfilling a promise to learn French, as an auditer.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tsap/csc366/">
CSC 366 - Computational Complexity and Computability</a><br>
I'm TAing for the engineers this term. Actually, they tend to ask better
questions, I can't complain.
</ul>

These are my courses from the fall term 2001.

<ul>
<li>CSC 2427 - Structured Families of Graphs<br>
Taught by my supervisor Derek Corneil, an interesting look at assorted
themes linking important types of graphs.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~chechik/courses01/csc2108/">
CSC 2108 - Automated Verification</a><br>
A look at model checking and theorem proving. And it qualifies for the
software engineering breadth requirement (lucky me)!
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rackoff/2426f01/">
CSC 2426 - Topics in Cryptography</a><br>
Charles Rackoff's view of the theories behind security and cryptography.
Challenging yet lots of fun.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~abm/324/">
CSC 324H - Principles of Programming Languages</a><br>
I'm TAing this course... teaching tutorials, marking assignments,
you know, the usual.
</ul>
