On the k-splittable Flow Problem

Abstract:
In traditional multi-commodity flow theory, the task is to send a
certain amount of each commodity from its start to its target node,
subject to capacity constraints on the edges.  However, no restriction
is imposed on the number of paths used for delivering each commodity;
it is thus feasible to spread the flow over a large number of
different paths.  Motivated by routing problems arising in real-life
applications, such as telecommunication, unsplittable flows have moved
into the focus of research.  Here, the demand of each commodity may
not be split but has to be sent along a single path.
<p>
In this talk, a generalization of this problem is studied.  In the
considered flow model, a commodity can be split into a bounded number
of chunks which can then be routed on different paths.  In contrast to
classical (splittable) flows and unsplittable flows, already the
single-commodity case of this problem is NP-hard and even hard to
approximate.  We present approximation algorithms for the single- and
multi-commodity case and point out strong connections to unsplittable
flows.  Moreover, results on the hardness of approximation can be
shown, i.e., one can show that some of our approximation results are
in fact best possible, unless P=NP.

Optimal distance labeling schemes and small universal distance

Abstract:
A distance labeling is a pair &lt;L,f&gt; of functions such that L
assign to each vertex x of a given graph G a binary string L(G,x)  and
given two such binary strings L(G,x) and L(G,y), f outputs the distance in
G between x and y. From the complexity perspective, the goal is to
minimize the size of the binary strings L(G,x) and to design a constant
time function f to answer distance queries.
<p>
It is known that distance within a 1 additive error can be obtained from a
labeling scheme using labels of O(log n) bits for an n node interval
graph. For exact distance, the previous best result required O(log^2 n)
bit labels. We show that only O(log n) bits are enough to get the exact
distance. This upper bound is tight since there are 2^{\Omega{n\log n}} n
node interval graphs.  Moreover the labels can be computed in O(n) time.
<p>
Roughly, the exact distance labeling scheme is derived from a 1-additive
scheme.  We then show that the graph of error (there is an edge between 2
vertices if the 1-additive scheme does not ouput the exact distance) is a
permutation graph. Therefore there exists a 2\log n adjacency labeling
scheme for the graph of errors.
<p>
If time permits, some hints for the lower bounds on the number of interval
graphs will be given.
