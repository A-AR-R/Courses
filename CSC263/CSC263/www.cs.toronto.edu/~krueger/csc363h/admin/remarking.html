<h2>Policy on remarking requests</h2>

<ul>

<li>All remarking requests must be received
    within <strong>two weeks</strong> of the date
    when the assignment or test was returned.
    (It is your responsibility
    to pick up your assignment or test
    from the CSSU, in room BA&nbsp;2283,
    if you were not in lecture or in tutorial
    when it was returned.)
</li>

<li><em>We CANNOT accept remarking requests
    for term tests that were written using pencil!</em>
</li>

<li>Your mark will decrease
    if the marker sees something
    that was incorrectly awarded too high a mark.
</li>

<li>If there is a simple addition mistake in your assignment or test,
    just show the work to your instructor
    (<em>not your TA</em>).
</li>

<li>For <em>all other</em> remarking requests,
    please print <a href="remark-form.txt">this remarking form</a>,
    fill it in <em>completely</em>,
    and attach it to your assignment or test.
    (Remarking requests will not be considered
    if the remarking form is missing or incomplete.)<br />
    You must be specific
    and clearly demonstrate that the marking scheme
    was not followed correctly for your assignment or test.
    Note that marks are awarded based on <em>merit</em>,
    not on need,
    so statements like
    "I worked really hard" or
    "I really need those marks"
    are not good reasons.
</li>

<li>Give the form and your assignment or test
    directly to the marker or to your instructor.
    <em>Remember to submit your work together with the form.</em><br />
    If you are comparing your work to that of another student,
    hand in BOTH assignments or tests
    (your request will be ignored otherwise).
</li>

<li>If you are still not satisfied
    after getting back your remarked assignment
    (or after having a meeting with the marker),
    contact your instructor
    to discuss your situation.
</li>

</ul>
