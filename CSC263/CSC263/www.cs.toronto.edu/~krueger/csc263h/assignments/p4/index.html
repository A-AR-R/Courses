<h3>Programming question for Homework 4: TTC trip planner</h3>

<p>
In this assignment you will be modifying your Dijkstra's algorithm
implementation from your previous programming
assignment to construct a rudimentary bus/subway trip planner.
Some rudimentary data regarding TTC bus, streetcar and subway routes
will be made available for you to test your program.
A basic text interface system is provided for you.
</p>

<p>
You will modify your Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm
from assignment 3 (or as described in CLRS) to support queries on a
much more complicated graph structure. The TTCGraph extends the graph
data structures you developed in assignment 3 to store information
about when and where buses (or other transit vehicles) transit.
Each edge represents a particular route joining two consecutive stops
(since many routes may run between two locations, this is a multigraph).
We have provided code to parse input files and generate some of the
graph structure; you will need to complete the weight function which
will give how long a customer needs to wait for the next
bus/train/etc. and transit to the next stop.
Your modified Dijkstra algorithm will use this dynamic weight function
to try to find a shortest route between two given locations in the
loaded transit network.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>/u/csc263h/fall/pub/p4/data</tt> directory on CDF contains
a number of files describing the lists of stops and stop times for
several actual TTC routes (routes 1 through 4 represent the subway and
SRT routes). These data are parsed from the <tt>../rawdata</tt> files,
which were downloaded directly from the TTC website.
Though some of the <tt>data</tt> files contain accurate data, many
routes contain estimated data and a reduced number of stops to
help simplify your testing process.
</p>

<p>
This assignment is somewhat open-ended: you are free to improve this
code in any way you wish. A few marks will be devoted to design
improvements or extra features. You will include a <i>short</i> report
(in a <tt>report.txt</tt> file)
describing how you implemented the missing TODO portions of code, and
any extra features you chose to implement.
Your report <b>must not</b> be more than one page (66 lines by 80 columns!).
The bulk of the marks will
be for completeness and correctness of the TODO portions, with extra
marks devoted to any extra features you successfully implement.
</p>

<hr>
<p>For more details, including exact specifications of the
methods that you should implement, see the starter code.
You must complete the portions marked 
by comments that start with: "<code>// TODO:</code>",
however, you may also make any other modifications to the code
that you wish!
Be sure to describe any additional features you implement in
your report.

<p>
Since we are providing some starter code in the form of a <code>.jar</code>
file, you'll need either to add this file to your classpath (i.e.,
use a command like "<code>javac -cp .:Graph.jar:AVL.jar *.java</code>"
to compile and give the same option to <code>java</code> to run)
or unpack each .jar using a command like
"<code>jar xf Graph.jar<code>" (run for each .jar file).
