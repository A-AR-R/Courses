    <h1>DOS vs. Unix Line Endings</h1>

<p> Text files created on DOS/Windows machines have different line endings
	  than files created on Unix/Linux.  DOS uses carriage return and line
	  feed ("\r\n") as a line ending, which Unix uses just line feed
	  ("\n").  You need to be careful about transferring files between
	  Windows machines and Unix machines to make sure the line endings are
	  translated properly.</p>

<p> The CDF staff have written a thorough explanation of <a
															href="http://www.cdf.utoronto.ca/workathome/article.php3?id=49">converting between Unix and DOS files</a></p>

<p> In the directory /u/csc207h/winter/pub/bin, you will find a little Perl
	  program called <code>dos2unix</code> that will conver DOS line
	  endings to Unix line endings.  You can set your path to include this
	  directory so that you can run the program, or you can copy it to your
	  own bin directory. Run the program as <code>dos2unix
		&lt;filenmae&gt;</code>.  The file <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> is
	modified.</p>

<p><font color=red><b>IMPORTANT:</b></font> You must submit files in the CVS directory with
	  Unix/Linux file endings.  If you only use CVS to transfer files
	  between your home machine and CDF, you should not have to worry about
	  line endings.  However, you must test your programs on CDF before you
	  submit them. Shell programs, in particular, will fail in mysterious
	  ways if they contain DOS line endings.</p>
