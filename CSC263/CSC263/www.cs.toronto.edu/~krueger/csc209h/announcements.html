fixed a few typos and clarified the game rules and the server
command line parameters.
</p>
<p>

<b>Final exam schedule available</b><br>
The <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/undergraduate/exams/august-2006-exam-schedule">final exam schedule</a> has been posted.
I'm not allowed to tell you when or where the exam will be

<h3>Sunday, 16 July 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Sample A3 executables posted</b><br>
Sample <tt>bjplayer</tt> and <tt>bjdealer</tt> executables
are now available in the <tt>/u/csc209h/summer/pub/a3</tt> directory
on CDF. If you want them accessible from your own directory, use a 
symbolic link instead of copying them (thus, when I correct any bugs,
your "copy" will automatically be fixed).
Something like <tt>ln -s /u/csc209h/summer/pub/a3/bjdealer sample.bjplayer</tt>
will link it in the current directory under whatever name you want (so its
name doesn't conflict with your programs).
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Saturday, 15 July 2006</h3>
<p>
<b><tt>utils.c</tt> corrected</b><br>
Lionel let me know that I introduced a couple bugs in the <tt>utils.c</tt>

<b>Server outage again today</b><br>
It seems that power outage fried a RAID fileserver, so there will be another
outage this afternoon (which will likely make the course website inaccessible).
Hopefully things will be fixed fairly quickly.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 14 June 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Servers return to life</b><br>
Looks like recovering from that power outage this morning took longer than
expected, but everything seems back to normal now. If you haven't used the
<a href="forms.html">online form</a> to tell us you're using some grace days yet,
please do so now. (If you're not using grace days, no need to do anything.)
</p>

<b>Planned power outage (thus, also a network outage)</b><br>
I have been informed that there will be a power outage in Sandford Fleming
the early morning of Wed, June 14th. Some CDF and CS services will be
affected (such as wireless and the course webpage), and may not be available
after 5pm on Tuesday June 13th. Though this is after the assignment due date,
if you are forced to use some of your grace days, keep in mind that the
course webpage and online specification might not be available during the
outage.
</p>

<b>CDF TA available</b><br>
Jonathan Lung has been appointed so serve as CDF TA for the summer.
The primary purpose of the CDF TA is to assist students
in using CDF workstations, and connecting to CDF from laptops and
from offsite computers.  Optional tutorials will be scheduled on
topics related to use of CDF with details posted as soon as they're 
available. Feel free to ask him
questions about using CDF during CDF TA hours.
</p><p>
Tentative CDF TA hours will be in BA2210, at computer b2210-25 as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Tuesdays noon until 2:00pm
  <li>Wednesdays 5:00pm until 6:00pm
  <li>Thursdays noon until 2:00pm
</ul>
<p>
The computer b2210-25 will be reserved for the CDF TA during CDF TA hours.
A cork board is located in BA2210, by the computer b2210-25,
to display CDF information and notices useful to students.

<p><b>Network difficulty: DDoS attack today</b><br>
From the system administrators:
Please be advised that the University of Toronto is currently
experiencing a Denial of Service Attack:
(http://www.noc.utoronto.ca/net-ops/events.shtml)
<br>
05-June-2006<br>
11:30  We are currently experiencing Internet connectivity problems due
to a DDoS attack at Cogent.  Cogent engineers are investigating.
</p>
<p>
It seems that effects of the attack has subsided. Hopefully we'll have
some time later in the course to briefly discuss what this was and how
this happened.
</p>

<p>
<b>CVS Repositories set up</b><br>
The CVS repositories have been created. If you were registered before 
today, then you should have a repository.  If you registered later,
you will probably need to email me about getting a repository set up.

If you want to check out a local copy of your repository on CDF, you
will need to set <code>CVSROOT</code> as follows.  Replace <code>yourid</code>
with your CDF user id.
</p>

<pre>
# in tcsh (the default shell on CDF)
setenv CVSROOT /u/csc209h/summer/pub/repo/yourid

# in bash
export CVSROOT=/u/csc209h/summer/pub/repo/yourid
</pre>

<p>
If you are trying to connect to the repository from home, you will need
to set your <code>CVSROOT</code> to the following string.  
(Please note that it may be slightly different depending on the
application you are using.)
</p>

<pre>
:ext:yourid@cdf.utoronto.ca:/u/csc209h/summer/pub/repo/yourid
</pre>

<p>
You will also need to set <code>CVS_RSH</code> to <code>ssh</code> if
you are connecting from a remote machine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can check out the repository:
</p>

<pre>
cvs co assignments
</pre>

<p>
Now you will have a directory called <code>assignments</code> containing
5 directories: <code>CVS, a1, a2, a3, a4</code>.

You should do your work for assignment 1 in the <code>a1</code> directory, and
commit your work early and often to take advantage of the version control
features.

<b>Make sure you check out the repository and make sure you know how
to use it before the due date for assignment 1.</b>
</p>
