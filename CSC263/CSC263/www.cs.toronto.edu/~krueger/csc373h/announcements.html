<b>A4 sample solutions posted</b><br>
Sample solutions to A4 are posted on the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a>
page. Apologies for the delay. Class average on A4 was 73.4% (not that it
means much). The class term average going into the exam is approximately 67%,
or 40/60.
</p>
<p><b>Office hours today</b><br>
Today's (Tuesday's) office hours are 11-5pm (slightly extended from previous
announcement). I will not be holding office hours tomorrow, though I will be
answering email.<br>
I will leave uncollected A4 and Test 2 papers outside my office
following my office hours--please collect only your own (or get permission
from your friends) and try to preserve other student's privacy by
avoiding looking at other papers.
</p>
<p><b>Important note about unauthorized aids</b><br>
The Registrar's office has requested that the following notice be included
on final exams:
</p>
<blockquote>
It is an academic offence for students to possess the
following items at their examination desks: cell phones, pagers of any
kind, IPODs, MP3 players, wristwatch computers, personal digital
assistants (e.g., palm pilots) or any other device that is
electronic. If any of these items are in your possession now, please
ensure they are turned off and put them with your belongings at the
front (or side) of the room before the examination begins --- no penalty
will be imposed. A penalty WILL BE imposed if any of these
items are kept at your examination desk.
<p>
Please note, students are NOT allowed to petition
to RE-WRITE a final examination.
</blockquote>
<p>
Please ensure that you do not possess any electronic devices at your desk
during the exam. Though they won't help you with the exam, they can get you
into a lot of trouble if you have them.
The University has become extremely strict with such devices, after some
students (probably non-CS) were caught trying to cheat with them,
and neither I nor the department have any control over consequences.

<p>
<b>More Test 2 notes</b><br>
I've added a few more thoughts regarding Test 2 on the
<a href="tests">Tests</a> page.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 15 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Test 2 information</b><br>
Coverage and details for test 2 were discussed in today's lecture.
Additional details will be posted to the <a href="tests">Tests</a> page.<br>
Speaking of tests, make sure you check the
<a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3reg/timetable/cal_pub.php">final exam schedule</a>,
now available.
</p>
<p><b>A3 clarification</b><br>
For question 2, you must give a divide-and-conquer algorithm;
any other type of algorithm will receive only part marks.
(The whole point of the question is to make sure that you review and
understand the closest-points algorithm presented in class.)
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 14 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A3 reminder</b><br>
You may use any results that are proved in the textbook, in lecture, or
in tutorial. For example, you do not have to reprove Ford-Fulkerson's
algorithm or closest pair of points algorithm if you use it to solve a
question on the assignment.
</p>
<p><b>Course evaluations week</b><br>
This week we'll be doing course evaluations in lecture and in tutorial.
Be sure to attend and give us feedback.
</p>
<p><b>A2 extra credit now online</b><br>
For those who handed in A2 by the original due date, the online marks
now include the extra credit that I promised. A2 remarks are also now
included online.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 6 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A3 update</b><br>
A slight update to A3... I've removed part (d) of question 1.
The online handout has been updated.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 5 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 marks available</b><br>
Marks for assignment 2 are now <a href="marks">posted online</a>.
The TA will return the assignments in tutorial on Friday.
</p>
<p><b>Assignment 3 posted</b><br>
Assignment 3 is now available on the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a>
page.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Saturday, 4 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 update</b><br>
Unfortunately, A2 won't be returned until next Friday. Marks should be
available online by Tuesday, though. If you need to enquire about the
marking of your assignment before then, please send me an email.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 1 March 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Test 1 returned, marks posted</b><br>
Test 1 was returned in class today. If you didn't pick it up, you can pick
it up during my office hours. Please check the 
<a href="marks">online marks posting</a> to
make sure your grade is recorded correctly.
</p>
<p>
Though the marks may have been a little lower than you expected, don't worry.
Solving problems with these techniques take experience, which you will
gain through the course. It is normal for students to raise their grades
at the end of a course like this. I'll also adjust the format of the next
test (based on student feedback) to make it less stressful.
</p>
<p>
The TA said she would try to mark and return A2 on Friday in tutorial; if so,
I will have the uncollected assignments at my office hour on Monday.
</p>

<b>Reading Week: change of office hours</b><br>
Due to Reading Week, I am changing my office hours. They will be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monday, February 20 -- <i>cancelled</i>
  <li>Wednesday, February 22 -- 10:00am to 11:00am (<i>earlier</i> than usual)
</ul>
<p>
You can always email me if you can't make it during this time.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 15 February 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A2 extension granted</b><br>
Due to several requests for relief, I will accept A2 until 12:00 noon
on Monday, February 27. There is a CSC373S drop box near SB 1155
(just down the hall from the CS computer lab), or you can hand it to
me in office hours.
</p>
<p>
To be fair to those students who worked hard to make the original due date,
extra credit will be granted to those who hand in to the TA on Friday.
</p>

<h3>Monday, 13 February 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Week 6 notes posted</b><br>
I have finally posted the week 6 notes on the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a>

</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 6 February 2006</h3>
<p>Oodles of announcements today!</p>

<p><b>Online marks available</b><br>
Please check that the <a href="marks">online marks</a> posting correctly reports your marks.
Also, be sure to change your password when you log in to protect your grades
from anyone else who might know your student number.
</p>

<p><b>A1 return (continued)</b><br>
For those of you who haven't picked up A1 yet, they are available on my
office door. Please read and heed the comments from the TA -- they are
designed to help you improve you proof-writing skills, particularly for
the rest of the course. The class average on the assignment was around
44/60, not that it means anything.
</p>

<p><b>Toward A1 solutions</b><br>
A link containing hints towards A1 solutions have been added to the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.
Sorry but they aren't full solutions.
</p>

<p><b>Lecture summaries posted</b><br>
I've recently surprised (and been surprised by) a few students that
lecture summaries are posted on the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
I'm not sure how you missed the links when looking up your weekly
homework readings, but they are there.
</p>

<p><b>Dynamic Programming talk Thursday on Downtown Campus</b><br>
The CSSU, the computer science students' union on the St. George campus,
is hosting a technical talk on dynamic programming this Thursday at noon.
The seminar will be given by Igor Naveriouk, a UofT graduate student and
head of the UofT Programming Contest Team. The talk will probably concentrate
more on problem solving using dynamic programming, but should be very
interesting if you happen to be downtown Thursday.
<a href="other/dptalk.txt">Details are here.</a>
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sunday, 5 February 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A1 return</b><br>
Assignment 1 has been marked and is ready for return.
You can pick up your assignment during my office hours on
Monday. Look for additional information posted Monday.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Saturday, 4 February 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Test 1 information</b><br>
Some details regarding Term Test 1 have been posted to the
<a href="tests">Tests</a> page.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 26 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A1 Q4 clarification</b><br>
The following clarification was added to the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page:
</p>
<blockquote>
For question 4, once you have an algorithm,
also give a short proof that your algorithm is correct.
A full proof is not necessary for this question.
You should also justify that your algorithm is efficient (i.e., polynomial).
</blockquote>
<p>
The phrase "and give a short proof that your algorithm is correct."
clarifying this was accidentally omitted from the assignment handout.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 24 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Minor clarification to A1 Q3</b><br>
I've posted a minor clarification for Q3 on the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page, since some students seemed
a little confused on what they needed to prove.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Friday, 20 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Reference for red-blue generic algorithm MST problem</b><br>
Note that the "red-blue" generic algorithm for minimum spanning trees,
and the associated proof, were first presented by Robert Tarjan in his book:
"Data Structures and Network Algorithms".
We've been told that this book is available for free through the
UofT library: <A href="http://library.books24x7.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/toc.asp?site=V38VL&amp;bookid=9433">Tarjan's book</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Thursday, 19 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>New TA</b><br>
We've had a change in TAs for the course.
The new TA is Tobi Kral, whom you will meet in this week's tutorial.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 18 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Assignment 1 released</b><br>
The first homework has been posted to the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a>
page. Note that it is due at the start of tutorial -- late assignments will
not be accepted. Start now, and ask questions in tutorial or office hours!
</p>
<p><b>Lecture summaries updated</b><br>
The lecture summaries on the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page
have been updated. They might help with completing your assignment.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 10 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Lecture topics and readings</b><br>
The <a href="lectures">lectures and assigned readings</a> page is now up.
Before lecture I'll be posting the topic(s) to be covered and textbook
readings I expect you to have read before class. After lecture I intend
to post some notes outlining what I covered, particularly if it differs
from the textbook.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Wednesday, 4 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>No tutorial this week</b><br>
There will be no tutorial held this week. The first tutorial will be during
the second week of classes, on January 13.
</p>
<p>
<b>Textbook in the bookstore</b><br>
The textbook is available in the bookstore, but it is listed under the course
CSC 363 on their textbook lists. This is a mistake. It should say 373 (363 is
another course, but it isn't being offered at UTM this semester).
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Tuesday, 3 January 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Welcome!</b><br>
Welcome to CSC 373! All course announcements will be posted to this page,
in reverse chronological order. Be sure to check back often.
