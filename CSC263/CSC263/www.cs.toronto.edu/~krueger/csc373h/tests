<h2>General information</h2>

<p>
Check the <a href="#pastofferings">past course offerings</a>
section for links to previous offerings of this course,
where you can find term tests and assignments to practice on.
</p>

<p>
The term tests will last <em>50 minutes</em>
and will be held during regularly scheduled lecture time.
</p>

<p>
If you have any serious conflict
with the time or date of the test(s),
please inform your instructor <em>immediately</em>
to make alternative arrangements.
</p>

<p>
The midterm test will be <em>closed book</em>
(<em>i.e.</em>, NO aids allowed),
and should be written in <em>pen</em>
(remarking requests for tests written in pencil will not be accepted)
&mdash; the test paper will have lots of room for rough work.
</p>

<h3>The "20% rule"</h3>

<p>
We want to encourage you to be aware of (and honest about)
what you know and what you do not know,
because it's important to be aware of the level of your own knowledge.
(Also, to be quite frank,
this will spare you the trouble of writing
&mdash; and us the trouble of reading &mdash;
lots of random or irrelevant bits of information
in the hopes of getting a few part marks.)
For this reason,
if you cannot answer a question
(or part of a question)
on a term test or on the final exam,
you will receive 20% of the marks for that question
(or part of a question) if you write
</p>
<blockquote><p>
      <em>I don't know.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(or something similar)
in the space reserved for your answer.
<em>You will NOT receive the 20%
if you leave your answer completely blank,
or if you write anything in addition to the sentence above</em>,
because neither of those cases
show that you are aware of what you don't know.
However, if you cross off an answer that you realized was wrong
(so it will not be marked),
and then write the sentence above,
you will receive the 20%.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is certainly possible to get less than 20% on a question,
if you write an answer that is mostly incorrect.
Note also that this rule <em>does not apply on assignments</em>,
where you have the time (and the responsibility)
to ask questions and learn how to solve each problem.
</p>

<h2><a name="final">Final Examination Details</a></h2>

<p>
The final exam will be written at the time set by the
<a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3reg/timetable/cal_pub.php">Final Exam Timetable</a>.
Make sure you note the date, time and room carefully.
</p>

<p>
The exam is set for <i>three hours</i> in length.
The exam is <i>closed-book</i> but a <i>handwritten</i> notes-sheet is
permitted as your only aid.
It must be a US letter-sized sheet of paper (8.5" by 11") and must contain
only hand-written notes on both sides.
You must make your notes-sheet available to the exam presiding officers
for inspection at any time.
Make sure you have only handwritten notes on the sheet: otherwise is will
be confiscated and you may face penalties and sanctions as specified by the
Registrar's Office.
</p>

<p>
The final exam will consist of 5-6 questions.
Each will consist of a problem (or series of related problems) for which
you will give an efficient algorithm to solve or approximate,
prove that an algorithm solves or approximates the problem, or both.
</p>

<p>
The exam will cover the following topics: greedy algorithms and their proofs,
dynamic programming algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms,
expressing problems using network flow, expressing problems as linear programs,
and approximation algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The textbook exercises and past exams are good sources of study questions.
In the back of each chapter there are solved exercises you can try and check,
and many problems you can try solving.
The Past Course Offerings section contains links to some of these exams.
The Faculty of Arts and Science on St. George campus also has a website
containing many of the past final exams for their courses.

<h2><a name="test2sol">Term Test 2 Answers</a></h2>

</p>


<h2><a name="test2">Term Test 2 Details</a></h2>

<p>
The second term test will be 50 minutes long, and written in the first hour
of lecture on March 22. The test will take place in the regular lecture
room. No aids will be allowed (closed book, no calculators, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Coverage and test format was decided in class prior to the test.
The test will cover divide-and-conquer algorithms and network flow.
I will provide to you the Master Theorem, so you don't need to memorize it
-- concentrate instead on how to use it (or better yet, on how to come up
with and analyze divide-and-conquer algorithms).
I expect you to know:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>how to come up with and argue running time of a simple
  divide-and-conquer algorithm,
  <li>the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum network flow,
  <li>how to prove a flow is maximum and how to find a minimum
  capacity cut, 
  <li>how to model simple problems as network flows, and
  <li>how to use a flow to extract a solution for such a problem.
</ul>

<p>
Sample solutions to Assignment 3 will not be available online before the
test, though the TA went through them in tutorial. There is a chance marks
might be available prior to the test, so watch the Announcements page.
</p>

<p>
The term test 2 from last year might be a useful practice tool:

<h2><a name="test1">Term Test 1 Details</a></h2>

<p>
The first term test will be 50 minutes long, and written in the first hour
of lecture on February 8. The test will take place in the regular lecture
room.
</p>

<p>
The test will cover greedy algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms.
Questions will typically ask for to come up with an efficient algorithm
to solve some problem, prove that an algorithm is correct, or both.
Problems will be similar to homework problems (except easier).
Often test problems are related to or similar in nature to problems you
have seen in lecture, tutorial, or in the assigned readings from the textbook.
I will try to return Assignment 1 prior to the test, so you can get feedback
from the TA.
</p>

<p>
The format of the test is four problems, do three.
Read over the entire test first, then choose which problems you would
like to solve. Only three problems will be marked, so don't try to
finish all four... you won't get any extra credit.
