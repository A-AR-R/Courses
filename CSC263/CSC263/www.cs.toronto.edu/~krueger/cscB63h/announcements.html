<b>A1 marks posted</b><br>
The assignment 1 marks are finally available online on the
<a href="marks">Marks</a> page. A recent web server upgrade
broke some stuff, which took me until now to work around.
Be sure to check that things are recorded correctly, as these
marks are generated directly from my records. You may also want to
change your password so that your grades remain private in case
anyone knows your student number.

<p>
<b>A1 hints and programming question</b><br>
I have posted a few hints and clarifications for assignment 1,
and posted the programming question. I have also posted some answers
to frequently asked questions about submitting the programming portion.
All this is on the <a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page.

<p>
<b>Lecture notes online</b><br>
Notes have been posted for the lectures to date. Please note that these
notes are not a replacement for the notes you make during class, but are
intended to supplement them in case you don't get time to write something down
correctly. Sometimes the notes I'll post are similar to what I cover in
class; other times they may be less or more detailed.
The "tutorials" are often integrated into the classes this term.
The notes are available on the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
