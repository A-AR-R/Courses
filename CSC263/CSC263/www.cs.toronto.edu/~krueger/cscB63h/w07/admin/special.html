<h2><a href="..">CSC B63</a>: Policy on special consideration</h2>


<p>
If you are unable to complete homework
or if you miss a quiz or term test
due to major illness
or other circumstances completely outside of your control,
please contact your instructor <em>immediately</em>
in order to receive special consideration.
Note that special consideration
will be considered on an individual basis
and will <em>not</em> be given automatically.
</p>

<p>
In order to receive special consideration,
you must fill out the following
<a href="special-form.txt">Request for Special Consideration</a> form
and bring it to your instructor
(or send an email including this information)
together with your supporting documentation.
Requests for special consideration must be presented
to your instructor and not a TA.
</p>

<p>
In the case of illness,
medical documentation <em>must</em> be supplied
on the standard University of Toronto Scarborough
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~registrar/registration/files/UTSCmedicalcertificate.pdf">Student Medical Certificate</a>
(Adobe PDF document).
You can also obtain a paper copy of this certificate
from your college registrar.
(A simple "note" from your doctor is not acceptable.)
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
<em>Notify your instructor as soon as possible if you find yourself in
such a situation.  It is always easier to resolve situations earlier
rather than later.</em>
</p>
