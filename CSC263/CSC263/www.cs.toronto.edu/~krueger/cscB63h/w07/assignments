  <li>Hints and clarifications:
  <ul>
    <li>Q2b should ask how to implement the above FOUR operations
    (not three, as it was originally written). This has been corrected.
    <li>The AVL trees handout the assignment refers to can be found on
    the <a href="../lectures">Lectures</a> page in the week 3 readings.
    <li>Q2: A few clarifications to keep you on track.
    <p>
    The database D stores a set of ship records for all the ships
    that are already moored in the port.
    <p>
    Each ship record in D is represented by some pair (p,c),
    where p is the pier location of the ship, and c is the ship's
    present capacity.
    <p>
    During an INSERT, you are given a pointer x to a ship record (p,c)
    and your task is just to insert this new record into the database D.
    <p>
    Note that in this question you are NOT concerned about how a pier
    is assigned to a ship when it docks (this assignment is
    done by some procedure that is external to this database):
    As far as you are concerned, when a ship of capacity c docks,
    it already has a given pier number p (that you cannot change).
    So all you have to do for an INSERT is to enter the new ship record (p,c)
    into the database D.
    <p>
    The pier number of ship record is fixed and never changes
    (because a docked ship does not change pier).
    <p>
    Do not assume that there is a small number of pier locations,
    or of ship capacities (a ship capacity can be any real number).

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

<p>
Assignments will consist of
a number of "pen-and-paper" questions
(the "written" portion,
whose solution involves no computer programming and
can be handwritten or typed)
and a number of "programming" questions
(whose solution is entirely computer programming).
</p>
<p>
The written portion must be handed in using the
<a href="../admin/cover.pdf">cover sheet for assignments (Adobe PDF document)</a>
<a href="../admin/cover.ps">(PS)</a>.
If you are working in a group (of at most two students),
only submit one copy of your solutions and write both
students' names on the cover sheet.
All written portions must be submitted
directly to the instructor by the beginning of class
on the specified due date.
Late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted
(including assignments submitted after the first 5 minutes of class)
except in truly unusual circumstances.
(See the
<!--
<a href="../admin/index.shtml#dates">important dates</a>
for the exact due date of each assignment, and the
-->
<a href="../admin/special.html">policy on special consideration</a>
for how to request an individual extension for unusual circumstances).
</p>
<p>
The programming portion must be handed in electronically
using the UTSC submit command.
Hardcopies (such as computer printouts) will not be accepted,
as your code will be executed to determine your mark. 
If you are working in a group (of at most two students),
only submit one copy of your programming solutions
and include both students' names in the file headers.
Though your programming portion is due at the same time as the
written portion, we will not collect the electronic submissions
until Thursday at 5:30pm (so you may think of this as an automatic extension).
It is your responsibility to ensure your programming solution is
submitted on time, as we cannot automatically disable acceptance
through submit at a predetermined time.
Ensure your programs work correctly on the UTSC computer system;
if they do not, you will not receive any credit.
</p>
<p>
Frequently solved problems:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>I need a computer account. How do I get one?</i><br>
  Go to the website: <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~accounts/newaccount.cgi">https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~accounts/newaccount.cgi</a>

  <li><i>How do I submit my files?</i><br>
  Make sure you're in the directory that contains the file(s) you want
  to submit, and use the command:<br>
  <tt>submit -N </tt><i>&lt;assignment&gt;</i><tt> cscb63s </tt><i>&lt;files&gt;</i><br>
  replacing <i>&lt;assignment&gt;</i> with the assignment name (PGM1, PGM2, ...)
  and replacing <i>&lt;files&gt;</i> with the list of files you are submitting.

  <li><i>I tried to submit and got the error:
    "submit: You're not in the cscb63s group." What do I do?</i><br>
  The computer system doesn't know you're in the class.
  Make sure that you're officially enrolled in the course.
  In general, if you enrolled in the class recently, you might have to wait
  a couple of days before the system administrators give you permission to
  submit files to our course.

  <li><i>I submitted an old version of my file, and now I want to resubmit
    my new version. How do I do it?</i><br>
  First of all, good idea! Submitting early and often makes sure the
  submit system is working for you, and if anything happens (you sleep in,
  your computer crashes, etc.), you already have a copy submitted for
  marking. We only keep the most recent copy that you submitted.
  To submit a new version, use the "-f" option for submit to overwrite
  the old version:<br>
  <tt>submit -N </tt><i>&lt;assignment&gt;</i><tt> -f cscb63s </tt><i>&lt;files&gt;</i><br>
</ul>
