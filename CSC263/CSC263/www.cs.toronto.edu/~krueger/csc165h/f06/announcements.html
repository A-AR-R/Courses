<b>Applying CSC 165 for fun and profit</b><br>
Now that we're nearing the end of CSC 165, how are you going to use it
(beyond getting awesome marks in any courses requiring proofs)?
Not only are you learning how to write proofs, but you're learning how
to think carefully and rationally, and how to reason precisely.
Exactly the skills you need to succeed in the following two fun applications.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/">ACM International Collegiate
  Programming Contest</a> is a world-wide competition where you solve
problems by writing short computer programs. The local U of T team is
off to the finals in Tokyo (all expenses paid) in March, where they can
win $10,000 US. To find out more, learn more about the contest, and
participate in future contests, visit the
<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~igor/acm/">U of T team page</a>
or email Igor Naverniouk (address is his first name at cs.toronto.edu).
The school team is formed in September each year, so get practicing now!
</p>
<p>
If Xboxes or solving puzzles without programming are more your thing,
Microsoft's annual
<a href="http://www.collegepuzzlechallenge.com/">College Puzzle Challenge</a>
might be interesting. Held each November at a number of schools across
North America, you try to solve the final meta puzzle, using solutions
from the other twenty puzzles to help you.
</p>
<p>
Past problems and solutions are available at each of these links.
Igor tells me there's a programming contest practice and introduction today
(Thursday) at 5:30pm in BA2270 (and pizza is included!).
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Monday, 20 November 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>Location for test today</b><br>
Just one more reminder that today's test will be written in GB 404,
not the regular lecture room. It will be held during the usual lecture time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Test 2 sample solutions</b><br>
Sample solutions for test 2 are now posted on the
<a href="tests">Tests</a> page.
</p>
<p>
<b>Uncollected work at CSSU</b><br>
Another batch of uncollected graded work was dropped off at the CSSU
(BA 2283) today. If you're missing any items that are posted to the marks
page, or requested a remark, check for it there.
</p>

<h3>Wednesday, 15 November 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A4 extension</b><br>
The due date for Assignment 4 is now extended to Friday November 17 at
5:00pm. Since you'll want the solutions posted in time to study for the
test (and the extension is beyond the grace day window anyway), no grace days
can be used to further extend the due date for this assignment.
</p>
<p>
However, if you hand in by the original due time (Thursday at noon), I'll
give you a 10% bonus on your assignment mark as a reward for finishing it
early. (Sorry, grace days can't be used to extend this offer either.)

<b>Test 2 location reminder</b><br>
Remember that Test 2, scheduled for Monday, November 20, will be held in
GB 404 (the same room as for the first test), and not in the regular lecture
room. The test will be held during the regular lecture time, though.
More information about the test itself is posted on the

Due to some requests, I've added some exercises to the end of the chapter 5
notes. Some have solutions, some don't. All are past quiz/test/exam questions.
Let me know what you think about having them added to the notes.
Using the newsgroup to discuss and post answers to the exercises
is probably a great idea.

<p>
<b>Please don't cheat!</b><br>
I received a message from the Associate Chair asking me to remind students
not to cheat (maybe somebody got caught in another course). Students who
cheat hurt themselves (not learning the material), hurt you
(imagine if a cheater graduates, gets a job,
and the boss realizes this person doesn't know anything... are they likely
to hire another U of T grad again?), and hurt society (would you like
to go to a doctor who cheated his way through med school?).
<ul>
<li>I know you didn't come into this course intending to cheat,
          but when the crunch hits, you may be tempted to ask for help that
          you know goes over the line.
<li>It's not worth it!  Students are often caught, and the penalties
          are serious.
<li>If a friend asks you, do not give in.  The person giving unauthorized
          help gets into as much trouble.
</ul>
<p>
If you're ever unsure what's acceptable, in this course or any other,
ask the instructor <i>before</i> doing it. Then you haven't done anything
wrong, you'll get clarity on what's expected, and your instructor will
respect you for being so forthcoming and on top of things.
</p>

<b>Updated chapter 4 notes</b><br>
I've posted an updated draft of chapter 4 (proofs) notes to the
<a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page. I still want to add a couple
examples, but I thought you'd want to get the summary pages before the quiz.
I've also posted Gary Baumgartner's summary of proof structure in the same
place.

<b>CDF outage update</b><br>
CDF is now restoring the file systems from recent backups, but they're
forcasting CDF won't be available until this evening. Also, any recent
file changes might be lost, depending on how old the backup was.
Fortunately this doesn't affect our course, but for your other CS courses,
rest assured your instructors are aware of this.

<b>Final Exam Schedule posted</b><br>
The Faculty of Arts and Science has posted the 
<a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/undergraduate/exams/december">December Exam schedule</a>.
You'll need to go there to check when your final exam is being held (a copy
will be posted at the undergraduate office)... I'm not allowed to tell you,
just in case I make an error!

<b>CDF filesystem down</b><br>
The CDF's RAID array that hosts students' and instructors' home directories
went down at around 7pm on Thursday, October 19, and its internal
configuration was lost.  The CDF staff is working on recreating the array
and restoring the data from recent backups.
I understand CDF is expected to be down until at least
tomorrow morning (Friday, Oct 20) as the system is repaired.

<b>CSSU Movie Night</b><br>
After all that studying for the test, you probably deserve some relaxation.
From the <acronym title="Computer Science Students' Union">CSSU</acronym>:
There is a movie night scheduled on the 18th of October that is a
WEDNESDAY. We are showing "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle" (they
get the munchies!!!!!). People this event is free and will take place at
BA 1190 at 9 pm sharp!!!!!!! There also may be the slight chance of free
pizza, i guess you'll just have to show up to find out...
</p>
<p>
<b>Career events</b><br>

<p>
<b>Missed getting your work when it was handed back?</b><br>
If we weren't able to return your marked work when we gave it back to
everyone else, don't worry, we didn't burn it! It's probably waiting for
you to pick up at the
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~cssu"><acronym title="Computer Science Students' Union">CSSU</acronym></a>.
Visit BA 2283 and get your work, and chat up the senior students hanging
around to get the inside info on CS.

<h3>Thursday, 12 October 2006</h3>
<p>
<b>A1 return delayed</b><br>
I've heard from the TA that A1 will not be ready to return this week.
Unfortunately, that means you'll probably not have it back before the test.
Instead, take a close look at the A1 sample solutions posted on the
<a href="assignments">Assignments</a> page, and be sure to ask if anything
seems strange or confusing. A2 solutions should be posted Friday afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<b>Missed tutorials</b><br>
If you have missed a tutorial, and you're looking for the tutorial exercises
to help you study, send me an email and I'll get you a copy.
The exercises are not posted, and solutions will not be posted either
(you can, however, ask friends, TA, office hours, etc. -- usually you learn
more from the discussion than just looking up the answers).

Due to the holiday Monday, the University will be closed October 9.
There will be no class and my usual office hours are cancelled this day.
To make up for it, I'm holding a make-up office hour on Tuesday, October 10
at 3-4pm in BA 3234. Bring all your assignment questions.<br>
The regular Wednesday office hour remains unchanged, and remember you
can always send email or post questions to the newsgroup.

Quiz 2 solutions are posted to the <a href="tests">Tests</a> page.
They should make an interesting and instructive read.
</p>
<p>
<b>New room for Term Tests</b><br>
It's a little early and I'll try to remind you next week, but the
Term Tests will be written in another room (one with tables, not those
awful arm tablets in the lecture room).
Both term tests will be written in GB 404 during the regular lecture time.
Further details are/will be posted to the <a href="tests">Tests</a> page.

Another instructor wrote a piece called
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fpitt/proving.html">
Why learning how to write proofs is like learning how to write programs
(is like bodybuilding)!</a>
This piece explains why we teach proof writing (and programming) in first

<b>Course notes posted</b><br>
The first 3 chapters of the course notes are finally posted on the
<a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
The course notes includes most of what we've done in class, sometimes

to the notes you take in lecture and tutorial, not a replacement.
</p>
<p>
<b>More A1 hints</b><br>
Some extra A1 hints have been posted to the

<b>CDF TA available</b><br>
A message from CDF said:<br>
We are pleased to announce a CDF Teaching Assistant will be available
this term.  The primary purpose of the CDF TA is to assist students
in using CDF workstations, and connecting to CDF from laptops and
from offsite computers.  Optional tutorials will be scheduled on
topics related to use of CDF with details posted as soon as they're
available. This term's CDF TA is Lucas Lochovsky.  Feel free to ask him
questions about using CDF during CDF TA hours.
<br>
Tentative CDF TA hours will be in BA2210, at computer b2210-25 as follows:<br>
Wednesdays 1:00pm - 3:00pm<br>
Thursdays  1:00pm - 2:00pm<br>
Fridays    1:00pm - 3:00pm<br>
The computer b2210-25 will be reserved for the CDF TA during CDF TA hours.

<b>Change to office hours</b><br>
A small change to my office hours, due to a room double-booking.
The Monday office hours have changed to 2:00pm - 3:00pm in the same room,

<p>
<b>Office hours</b><br>
I have set my office hours for Mondays and Wednesdays,
2:30pm - 3:30pm in BA 3234.
Use this time to ask any questions or clarifications about the course
material or assignments, discuss course topics, or even to ask 
general things about computer science or mathematical reasoning.
I encourage all students to come by office hours at least a few times
during the term.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some inspirational puzzles posted</b><br>
Some puzzles (those mentioned in class and others) have been posted to
the <a href="lectures">Lectures</a> page.
Have fun working on them, but don't be disappointed if you can't solve
some of them. I won't be providing solutions, but you'll probably be
able to solve them by the end of the course.
