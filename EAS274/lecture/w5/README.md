Using at least 2 of the readings (that is to say readings by at least 2 different authors), consider how commodity/consumerism plays a role in the NATIONAL imagined community. 

Stay focused on the NATIONAL imagine community: How do things (or a thing) in the readings help build the shared national identity (of either Japan or China.) c

You are limited to Japan or China because the readings this week are on Japan and China. 

Some questions that might help you think through the topic: Who buys/uses the thing(s)? What does it say about someone who buys/has this thing(s)? Does the thing(s) have certain qualities that mark it as "Japanese" or "Chinese"? What social role does it play? Who makes it? Who sells it? Who can afford to buy it? Who wants it but can't have it? 

For example, if you were doing the same exercise for SMAP, you would want to think about in what ways SMAP makes people feel they are part of a Japanese community. You would NOT want to spend time talking about a community of fans. 

A good answer will know what a National Imagined Community is and think about how smaller things can be a part of its production. It will also think about commodity (thing) and how it has a social role. Specific connections to the readings as well as your own thoughts.
