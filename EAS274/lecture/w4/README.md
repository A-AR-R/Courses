+ reading response 2
    + Option 1: What is the definition of "popular"? Trace the meaning/definitions of "popular" between at least 2 of Hall, Lie, and Soft Power readings. How they relate or contradict with each other? What is your own definition after doing the reading?
    
    + Option 2: Pick a song (not SMAP or Gangnam style) that you like (or hate, or find interesting) by an East Asian group or individual and explain how it is "representative of current media" in Japan/China or Korea. Use the Darling Wolf (SMAP) and/or Lie "Postlude" (Gangnam) to think about what kind of ways they look at music. Some questions to consider are: Who is/are the singer(s)? Who listens to them and why? What kind of performance do they give? What is the song about (and why)? Why is the song "catchy"? Why do you think the song resonates with listeners? YOU MUST ALSO make a connection to how the song relates (on any of those levels) to ideology and imagined community but what it tells listeners either visually, lyrically and/or musically.
