    + postcolonial state like north korea shaped by policies which is based on radical eradication of economic system under japanese rule
+ using women fashion to manage population
+ joseonot as a new socialinationalist fashion code, away from colonial legacies
    + Kim condemned certain fashion, critique of nonworing bourgeois bodis associated with urban decadence of the colonial era
    + western influenced fashion was accepted by educated upper-class women during japanese colonization, which represents remnants of colonial past and cultural traits of enemy class, the bourgeoisie
    + kim's mom bodily performance of ehtnically signified femininity and belligerent resoluteness is coded in the _joseonot_ she wears, the mother becomes the ideal standard for women's behavior and appearance. 
    + poster - 'let us be well prepared for winter!', women also wears joseonot, embodies working-class ethics and thereby becomes a state-endorsed antidote to the corrupting colonial past.

        + clothing transcends its materiality to symbolize character traits and connects the ethnically distinctive bodies of korean women with essentialist, nationalist characteristics
    + need to coordinate joseonot with surrounding environment
        + cover of magazine noting traditional attires of women with background image featuring modernizing state with afctories and tractors
    + women depicted as mediators of past and present, tradition and revolution
+ why it is women and not men who must conform to clothing standards?
    + pursuit of self-reliance / independence ideology, 
    + though there are attempts to promote women as aggresive revolutionary fighters, such policies eventually give way to more traditional approaches that emphasized domestic virtues of women as mothers and wives -- docile subjets of state discipline
    + the gap is wide,
    + women's domestic labor was a foundamental aspect of national economy .. 
+ _military uniforms: a new code of revolutionary virtue_
    + women participate in industrial and military efforts to resist colonial powers and defend the literated mothernland through hard labor and military tactics

+ Conclusion
    + fashion is one way for north korean leaders to configure and circulate politically normative ideas about female bodies, which have proven central to postcolonial nation-building
    + fashion gains its distinctive texture by weaving labor and art, production and consumption, and postcolonial desire to restore a national essence by reinforcing the ideals of untainted femininity

        + bleached-blonde hair
        + blue- hazel-tinted contact lens
    + tied to racial identity
        + tan themselves to appear less like Caucasian, western body
    + rooted in perception of racial difference and the dissemination of western racial ideals in Japan
+ Japanese Perceptions of Racial Difference 
    + _closed country_ sakoku
        + ended in 1853
        + Japan concerned with preservation of its sovereignty 
    + eager student of the west sciences and arts, set to building itself to a modern colonial power
        + problem: race of Japense people
        + modern knowledge absorbed by Japanese were saturated by ideas of white supremacy
        + colonism  
            + justified by hierarchies of race
    + lesson learnt
        + western civialization was visiting a racial destiny of subjugation or extinction upon seemingly inferior societies, and being Asian fated them to a lack of respect and freedom
    + Westernization of Japan invovles being told that racial inferiority of the Japanese was empirically verifiable 
        + by scientific racism domiance during the time 
    + race is a concept which signifies and symbolizes social conflicts and interests refferring to different types of human bodies
    + japanese anthropology establish sub-hierarchy within category of asians and with Japanese at the top and therefore closest to caucasians
        + cause of Japanese policy toward inferior korean / chinese
    + support and approval 
        + Japanese as honorary whites in south africa, alters position of Japanese people relative to the boundaries of racial identity
    + _exceptionalism_ 
        + desire to articulate a new position of the Japanese, one distanced from established racial categories while at the same time wholly dependent upon ideas of racial categorization
+ _racial change_
    + racial hierarchization, entailed incorporation, acceptance and modification of racial category has impact on Japan's economic and colonial polices
        + Japanese body as a way to fix Japanese within a particular racial category
        + but still difficult to seperate racial identity from ideals of modernity or westernization
    + upper eye-lid surgery, nose-bridge rising surgery
        + motivated by acceptance of a western ideal of attactiveness, 
    + consumption of western populary culture and bring about a change in racial significance of the Japanese body itself. 
+ _race as a style_ 
    + kogyaru is an example suggestive of a more complex dynamic at work behind a seeming obsession with western white body
    + white man as sex object and romantic targets
    + kogyaru and ganguro 
        + utilization of african american style in Japan
        + suggests a view of race that is partly about choice, particularly choices of consumption and style
        + less suggestive of a rigid racial hierarchy but a horizontal smorgasbord of racial associations that she can reach across to claim whatever combinations of markers she desires
        + increased plurality and playfulness in how racial significance is approached
        + creation of hybridized ideals of racials tyle
+ _The Kogyaru and Racial mimicry_ 
    + kogyaru style as evidence of failing racial hierarchization and differentiation
    + the style does not result from a sense of disillusionment with racial categorization but it continues an existing preoccupation with racial identities and a shifting Japanese relationship with them
    + Constitutes a _continuation_ and magnification of existing themes in the Japanese concept of race, where attemps to shift the Japanese position relative to racial categories - while resulting from an acceptance of racial difference and hierarchies - weakens racial discourse's claim to result from essentaialized biological differences
+ _Conclusion_ 
    + The history of Japanese interactions with discourses of race, during which the Japanese sought to change their position within a structure that demeaned and excluded them, while at the same time being influenced by ideas of white supremacy, has created circumstances under which this kind of fashion can come into being !
    +  interaction with racial differences are weakened and disorganized boundaries of race in all kinds of ways -- towrads a time when racial identities can decompose into a fragmented collection of markers and sylistic affectations, which can be playfully mixed and matched by young Tokyoites as they please
