    + transformation of superstructure, taking place more slowly that that of substructure, has taken more than half a century to manifest in all areas of culture the change in the conditions of productions
+ I
    + work of art is reproducible
        + man-made artifact could always be imitated by men

    + analogy
        + lithography -> illustrated newspaper
        + photography -> sound film
    + 1900 technical reproduction can reproduce all transmitted work of art

        + unique existence in the place
            + physical conditionn 
            + changes in ownership
    + authenticity
        + presence of original?
        + outside of technical reproducibility
    + product of reproduction maynot touch actual work of art, but the quality of its presence is depreciated
        + landscape vs that in movie
    + authenticity of a thing is the essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning
    + techniques of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition 
        + shattering of tradition
+ IV
    + uniqueness of work of art
        + inseparable from being imbedded in the fabric of tradition
        + the tradition is alive and changeable
    + earliest work of art originated in service of ritual
        + first magical, then religious 
    + unique value of authentic work of art has its basis in ritual, 
    + mechanical reproduction 
        + emancipates work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual
        + criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. Instead based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice-politics
