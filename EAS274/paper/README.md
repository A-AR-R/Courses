+ looks at your "thing" as a critical object using lenses leaned in class. Pay particular attention to how it contributes to state ideology (either as state ideology or as an Ideological State Apparatus) and how it contributes to an understanding of a national identity. 

+ ISA related: What gender roles are confirmed/established? Who benefits from the thing? Does anyone have negative effects? Who uses it? Who buys it? Who is about? Is there a relationship (positive or negative) between who uses it and who it is about? 

#### ISA 

+ established the role of a compassionate and conforming citizen (sohpie) in face of harsh conditions

    + conforming and accepting (to adversaries)
        + why work as a hatter?

            + still optimistic, jokes about his teeth (still there to eat the bread)
    + compassion/empathy
        + sensitive to the suffering of others and acts to alleviate it
            + place wood for alcifer, the fire demon.

    + japanese society, the government, Hayao Miyazaki
    + kids+adults watching the movie 
        + influenced by the cultural ISA behind it
        + would want to align their actions to such ideal 'best blaze burns brightest, when circumstances are at the worst'?

+ softpower 
    + japanese people buy in the depiction of env in the film   
        + environment 
            + set in picturesque western cities and wilderness, 
            + buildings in city, a prarie of flowers, the childhood hut
            + appreciate the every minute details in nature
        + destruction of natural beauty as window to anti-war themes
            + destruction of towns, the flowerbed
            + grotesque depiction of aircrafts, 
    + rural env depiction in Totoro
    + portrature of nature Princess Mononoke

+ commodity     
    + in addition to animated film as a form of entertainment
    + hope as a commodity 
        > The reason that we made "Howl's Moving Castle" is that there are too many unhappy matters in the world, such as wars and economic crises. We hope that, through the movie, people can keep up their courage and see the hope. The future world is still nice and beautiful. It is worthy for us to survive and explore it.



### Poster 

For class bring a poster presentation of your thing. 

Your presentation should be standard poster board size (about 24 by 36 inches or 46 by 61cm). 

Your poster should have:

1) A title

2) A CAREFULLY SELECTED image (or more than one)

3) Your main observations/points in bullet form. Clearly articulate how your paper will approach the thing, and how it relates to ISA and IC and one more lens at the very minimum.


+ Althusser has enhanced the Marxist theory of the state, by distinguishing the repressive apparatuses of the state from the ideological apparatuses of the state (ISA), which are an array of social institutions and multiple, political realities that propagate many ideologies — the religious ISA, the educational ISA, the family ISA, the legal ISA, the political ISA, the communications ISA, the cultural ISA, etc.
+  ISA disseminate ideologies that reinforce the control of a dominant class. People tend to be co-opted by fear of social rejection, e.g. ostracisation, ridicule and isolation. 
+ However, because ISA cannot dominate as obviously or readily as RSA, ideological state apparatuses may themselves become a site of class struggle. That is, subordinate social classes are able to find the means and occasions to express class struggle politically, either by utilizing ideological contradictions inherent in ISA, or by campaigns to take control of positions within the ISA.
+ shall therefore say that, where only a single subject (such and such individual) is concerned, the existence of the ideas of his belief is material in that his ideas are his material actions inserted into his material practices governed by material rituals which are themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which we derive the ideas of that subject.

+ Anderson depicts a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who perceive themselves as part of that group
+ a nation "is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion"

### Abstract 

Miyazaki Anti-War Films and Their Ideals

Films, similar to texts and other types of media, are fascinating tools for conveying cultural ideals and reflect upon societal complications, in other words, what the masses care about and what directors aspire to raise awareness towards. Here I will look at Miyazaki’s animated films that reflect on love and pacifism, and how they are commodities that the Japanese people consume and how the consumers form an imagined community with a common historic past and shared aspirations. Specifically, I will draw examples from two of his films, Howl's Moving Castle and The Wind Rises, as well as news report in the making of the two films.1,2 I will examine aforementioned materials using perspectives from Anderson’s Imagined Community and Marx’s The Fetishism of the Commodity. I will argue that Miyazaki’s films are commodities that satiates the craving for an idealized world of love and appreciation and consumers of his films form an imagined community out of an appreciation of such values and ideals. Miyazaki’s anti-war films seek to revolt against the conflicting contemporary political dynamics and to reconcile with the audience of the aspirations that he holds for a romanticized world
